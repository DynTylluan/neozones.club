<h1>Eluned</h1>
	<h4>wake up babe new playlist just dropped</h4>
	<p>I had the idea for this one kickin' around for a while, and although I'd still consider it a late-stage work-in-progress at the moment, I'm thrilled to get this beastie out there for all 0 of my loyal fans who care about what the hell I do on Spotify. So, anyways. I'm <em>formally</em> thinking of calling it Eluned. Informally, however, as with most of my other my playlists, it bears an agonisingly stupid title, one I came up with precisely at the time of its creation (and it shows): "if you eat straight alka seltzer tablets is it like really bad pop rocks". What</p>
	<p>This one ended up as what is essentially a 60s cesspoolâ€” an amalgamation of a few of my favorite genres, namely psychedelic, sunshine pop, a few different takes on classic rock, and, well... whatever the hell The Mysterians are up to. They're really just kind of their own thing.</p>
	<p>Notable names and faces on this one include Fleetwood Mac, Cream, Creedence Clearwater Revival & The Association, so if you happen to like any of those, there's a chance you'll find somethin' new in here you might dig as well. Enjoy, or don't; either way it's out of my hands now.</p>
