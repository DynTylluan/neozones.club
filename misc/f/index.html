In Loving Memory of Our Deceased Tech Products...</h1><p>
This page is dedicated to remembering the tech products that were taken offline
 before their time. Many still had a lot of users and people who loved them. We
 can only hope that they are smiling upon us from Silicon Heaven.</p><dl id=pressf>

<dt>AOL Instant Messenger (1997 &mdash; 2017)</dt><dd>AOL Instant Messenger -
 or just AIM as regular users called it - was an icon of its time. Many people
 enjoyed using the service made possible through America Online, where they
 were able to live chat with their cyberfriends in a time before SMS.<p>
AIM was turned off in the cold, cold winter days of 2017. All that still remains
 of the service is the AIM protocol, that looks like this;
 <a href="aim:goim?screenname=username">aim:goim?screenname=username</a></p>
Classic versions of AIM have been revived in a reverse-engineering project known
 as Phoenix, but it will never again boast the same number of users as in its
 heyday.</dd>

<dt>MSN/Windows Live Messenger (1999 &mdash; 2013)</dt><dd>Loved by many
 Microsoft users, this message service ran on Windows, Xbox 360, BlackBerry OS,
 iOS, Java ME and more.<p>
Following the acquisition of Skype Technologies in May 2011, Microsoft added
 interoperability between Skype and Microsoft accounts, allowing Skype (which
 had features unique to its platform and a wider user base) to communicate with
 Messenger contacts. In 2013, Windows Live Messenger was discontinued and
 Microsoft began ceasing service to existing clients. The service in China
 remained active for another 18 months, and ceased operations on Halloween
 2014.</p>
WLM's servers now have an open-source replacement in the Escargot project.
 However, as it's now something people must go out of their way to make use of,
 the number of people to chat with is lower than on more mainstream options.</dd>
 
<!--I'd add yahoo messenger here but honestly who tf even used that
 Also kinda weird that ICQ is somehow still around when its contemporaries
 dropped like flies

<dt>Xfire (2003 &mdash; 2015)</dt><dd>
Before Discord became the platform of choice for many gamers, there was
 Xfire. At a time when such features felt futuristic, it offered users the
 ability to chat while playing a game, browse detailed server lists, organize
 and share screenshots, download patches and demos, and even record and
 livestream video. But, more than all this, it was a community of people
 passionate about the games they enjoyed.</dd>

<dt>Club Penguin (2005 &mdash; 2017)</dt><dd>For any child born in the late 90's
 or early 2000's, <i>Club Penguin</i> served as a way to connect to the outer
 world of 250 million+ people. Club Penguin was more than a MMO, it was a way of
 life - a life that is sadly, no more.<p>
Since the death of the official game, many unofficial servers have been made,
 known as Club Penguin Private Servers (commonly abbreviated as CPPS). This
 includes Club Penguin Rewritten, launched in February 2017. These servers have
 reached a million players as of October 2017, despite their legal status being
 in question.</p><p>
Waddle on, Club Penguin.</p></dd>

<!--Other dead MMOs:
* ToonTown
* Tabula Rasa
* pre-Cataclysm World of Warcraft LOL J/K
-->

<dt>Vid.me (2014 &mdash; 2017)</dt><dd>Vid.me was a regrettably short-lived
 video sharing site, that sought to tackle some of the problems faced by smaller
 creators on YouTube. While it was around, it did make quite an impact on those
 users. Sadly, because of drastic changes in the advertising industry, Vid.me
 was forced to shut down in December 2017.</dd>
 
<!--Other dead video sites:
* blip.tv (intentionally killed by disney)
* GameTrailers
* Vanillo
probably tons of others i forgot about
-->

<dt>Sinclair ZX Spectrum (1982 &mdash; 1992)</dt><dd>With a CPU speed of 3.5 MHz
 and a memory size of 16 to 128 KB, the ZX Spectrum was a child of the 80's. All
 it wanted to do was to entertain people with fun little games made by
 enthusiasts, not for the money, but for the joy of it. The ZX stopped being
 made in 1992, five years before Sinclair Research went tits up, as the number
 of employees fell from 140 in the 1980s, to 3 in 1990, to only 1 in 1997.</dd>

<dt>GeoCities (1994 &mdash; 2009)</dt><dd>In the 90's, GeoCities opened the
 flood gates for people to learn HTML and express themselves on the Web. Sadly,
 in 1999, GeoCities was acquired by Yahoo!, who decided to shut it down ten
 years later. GeoCities will never be forgotten by its former residents.
 Thanks to the efforts of Archive Team, it did not go quietly - we are still
 able to walk its evicted halls via Oocities, Geocities.ws, and the Wayback
 Machine.</dd>

<dt>Rotten Dot Com (1997 &mdash; 2017)</dt><dd>Our beloved shock website,
 Rotten, sadly lost their server in September of 2017.
  <a href="//twitter.com/14Jammar/status/911223464375222273">To quote Jason
  Scott</a> who worked on and off for the site...
 <blockquote><tt><b>Clive Python:</b> You worked for Rotten right? So do you
 know what the fate of the site is?<br>
 <b>Jason Scott:</b> Lightning strike affected a system, no time set aside for
 maintenance<br>
 <b>Clive Python:</b> So does this mean the site will be offline from now on?<br>
 <b>Jason Scott:</b> I seriously doubt that.</tt></blockquote><p>
Rotten was a vile thing that shaped the Web for the better, being the starting
 point for freedom on the WWW.</p></dd>

<dt>Vine (2012 &mdash; 2017)</dt><dd>Vine was a mobile-based short-form video 
 hosting service that allows its users to create, upload and share looping video
 clips spanning up to six seconds in duration - and that's all it could do.
 Despite Vine only having a short life, it sure had an infamous one; raising
 terrible memes such as <i>Deez Nuts</i>, <i>21</i>, <i>What Are Those?</i> and
 many, many more.<p>
Originally developed by Dom Hofmann and Rus Yusupov in June 2012, the New York
 City-based startup was acquired by Twitter in October 2012 and introduced to
 the public in January 2013.</p><p>
Vine will only be missed by people who failed at school.</p></dd>
<!--Should we mention TikTok?-->

<dt>Tay (March 2016)</dt><dd>Tay was a chatterbot made by Microsoft and released
 on Twitter, the idea of the bot being to mimic a teenage girl. Tay caused
 subsequent controversy when the bot began to post inflammatory and offensive
 tweets through its Twitter account, forcing Microsoft to shut down the service
 only 16 hours after its launch.</dd>

<dt>Netscape Navigator (1994 &mdash; 2008)</dt><dd>Netscape was a fantastic web
 browser for its time. However, as the codebase grew messy enough to need a
 complete rewrite, it lost ground to IE. Thanks to the developers turning the
 code open-source before the company was absorbed into AOL, a 
 successor lives on today in the form of the Seamonkey suite.</dd>
 
<dt>Opera "Presto" (1995 &mdash; 2013)</dt><dd>Prior to becoming one of the
 numerous Chrome clones at version 15, Opera was a great alternative web browser
 with unique features and its own rendering engine, beloved by its diehard
 users. It always strived to be lightweight and snappy in spite of being 
 fully-featured, taking up as little as one-quarter of the space needed by its
 contemporaries.<p>
Version 12 for Windows recieved minor security updates in 2014 and 2016, but
 nothing has been heard since. Attempts to spiritually succeed classic Opera
 have resulted in the Otter and Vivaldi browsers.</p></dd>
 
<dt>Tumblr (2007 &mdash; 2018)</dt><dd>Okay, this place is still around.
 But, let's be honest, it's in a zombified state. Tumblr was formerly <b>the</b>
 destination for premier fandom content, hilarious shitposts, superb art and
 aesthetics, discussion of LGBT issues and POC experiences, and all the
 female-presenting nipples your dirty little brain could handle.<p>
Unfortunately, after being removed from the App Store, the decision was made to
 forbid all image and video-based adult content. The site began hemmoraging
 users, its traffic dropping by 30% over the next six months. According to
 some users, likes/reblogs have dropped by half, and the once-vibrant art
 community on the site is now a shadow of its former self.</p></dd>
<!--Because they all fuckin moved to Twitter, who also announced they're going
 to start getting rid of accounts who primarily post/retweet adult content.-->
 
<!--dt>SheezyArt (2003 &mdash; 2013)</dt><dd></dd
I want this place to be remembered because being part of it was fun as hell
 but like wtf do i even say about it, it was pretty much just SFW FA
 and then taken offline for a rewrite that never materialized
~bytemoth-->

<!--dt>Flash Player (1996 &mdash; 2020)</dt><dd>
* super futuristic dynamic content/games/art to spruce up ya basic af webpages
* newgrounds sonNnNnNn
* downfall began in 2007 with lack of iphone support
* eclipsed by html5 features, especially video tag
* bluemaxima flashpoint game preservation project
