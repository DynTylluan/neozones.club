			<h2>Artwork of Adolf Hitler</h2>
			<em>Written by Cass Python, 2018-07-04</em><br>
			Adolf Hitler is most know for being the leader of Nazi Germany, and planting the seed that would set off the bloody Second World War, killing millions of people in the process. What he is less know for is perhaps his love of art, and painting. Hitler produced hundreds of works (approximately 2,000 works have been said to have painted), and sold his paintings, and postcards to try to earn a living during his Vienna years (1908-13). A number of his artwork were recovered after the Second World War, and have been sold at auctions for tens of thousands of Pounds, with this, some of his art was seized by the U.S. Army after the war, and are even to this day, still held by the American government (<em>as seen with the photo on the right</em>), however, the majority of his work reportedly didn't survive the Second World War.

	<p>
	How much of his art was lost will probably never be truly released.</p>
	<p>
	Unlike most artists, Hitler did not let his own style grow over time, but instead opt in coping artists of the nineteenth century, and many of the masters preceding him. He claimed this to be the synthesis of many artistic movements, but it is quite clear that this is simply not true, and he did in fact have a large influence from Greco-Roman classicism, the Italian Renaissance and Neoclassicism. He liked the technical ability of these artists, as well as the understandable symbolism.</p>
	<p>
	It would seem that he would be inspired the most by Austrian landscape, and architectural painter Rudolf von Alt, going as far, and calling him his greatest "teacher". Both of the men use colour in a similar way, along with what the subject of the painting is about; however, in many of Rudolf von Alt art, he uses a fantastical landscapes giving equal-if not more-attention to nature, and the surrounding environment than the architecture - <em>Thanks, Wikipedia!</em></p>

	<h1>Ardoyes in Flandern (Ardoye in Flandern, 27 June 1917)</h1>
	Drawing of what appears to be a church. This was made at the same time he was a front-line soldier for the German army.
	<p>This has nothing to do with the art but it's still interesting, so according to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an Austrian citizen, he should have been returned to Austria.</p>

	<h1>House with a White Fence (Haus mit wei&#xDF;em Zaun, c. 1915-17)</h1>
	<p>Watercolour painting of the front-line during the First World War. As this painting has no date, it is hard to tell when it was made, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Adolf_Hitler_-_Haus_mit_weissem_Zaun.jpg">Wikimedia says c. 1917</a>, while <a href="http://www.bytwerk.com/gpa/hitlerpaintings.htm">The German Propaganda Archive says 1915</a>.</p>

	<h1>Hofbr&#xE4;uhaus (19??)</h1>
	<p>Painting Hitler did of Hofbr&#xE4;uhaus, M&#xFC;nchen, that is located at Am Platzl in M&#xFC;nchen, a beer hall that dates back to the 16th century.</p>
	<p>By comparing it to <a href="muenchen_hofbraeuhaus.png">this picture taken in 2012</a> you can see how it has changed over the years.</p>

	<h1>Ruin of a Monastery in Mesen (Klosterruine in Messines, Dezember 1914)</h1>
	<p>Much like a lot of his work, we really don't know much about this painting, apart from its location and who it is by.</p>

	<h1>Nude woman (1929)</h1>
	<p>Not much is known about these four drawings of a naked woman. We don't know who the woman is, or even if she's real. From looking at drawings one could guess that they were made at the same time.</p>

	<h1>Schloss Belvedere (19??)</h1>
	<p>Painting Hitler did of Schloss Belvedere in Wien. As you may have guessed, not much is known about this painting apart from it's location and who made it. By looking at <a href="schloss_belvedere_wien_2012.png">this photo taken in September of 2012</a> we can easily tell how Schloss Belvedere in Austria has evolved over the years since Hitler visited it.</p>

	<h1>Selbstportr&#xE4;t (1926)</h1>
	<p>From looking at the title of this alone you will easily be able to guess what it means (<i>"Self-portrait" for the slow</i>). <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/photo-gallery-hitler-s-watercolours-to-go-under-the-hammer-fotostrecke-45624-5.html">According to Spiegel Online</a>, this sketch was auctioned in August of 2009 for the pretty penny of &#xA3;12,300.</p>
	<p>As seen in this drawing, Hitler is seen with his trademark toothbrush moustache. The toothbrush moustache style first took off and became popular in the United States in the late 19th century, from where it <i>grew</i> to Germany and elsewhere. The style would reach its height of popularity in the inter-war years before becoming unfashionable after World War II due to its association with Hitler.</p>
	<p>Icon Charlie Chaplin would become one of the most famous uses of this style, adopting it sometime after 1914 for his role as the Tramp. In a 1933 interview Charlie Chaplin said that he had added the moustache to his Tramp charter because it had a comical appearance and was small enough so as not to hide his expression.</p>

	<h1>Standesamt M&#xFC;nchen (late 1900s-early 1910s)</h1>
	<p>Watercolour Hitler did of Munich town hall, capital and the most populated city in the German state of Bavaria. By comparing it to <a href="kleines_rathaus.png">this photo taken in 1900</a> we can see that Hitler did an alright job at painting. The original size of the work was 28 CM high with a width of 22 CM.</p>
	<p>As reported by <a href="https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/watercolor-attributed-to-hitler-sells-for-161000/">The New York Times</a> in November 2014, <i>Standesamt M&#xFC;nchen</i> was sold in a German auction house for around $161,000 or &#x20AC;130,000.</p>
	<p>The article goes on to explain how the fate of the painting was made-</p>
	<p><tt></tt></p>
	<blockquote>
		<tt>The painting <i>[...]</i> was purchased by a private buyer from the Middle East who attended the sale at Weidler auction house in Nuremberg, auctioneer Kathrin Weidler told Reuters. She did not give the buyer's name.</tt>
		<p><tt><i>[...]</i></tt></p>
		<p><tt>[The painting] was sold by two unidentified German sisters in their 70s whose grandfather bought the work in 1916. The women plan to donate about 10 percent of the sale to a charity for disabled children, Ms. Weidler said.</tt></p>
		<p><tt>The auction house estimates the work is one of about 2,000 paintings Hitler created between 1905 and 1920 when he was a struggling artist in Vienna.</tt></p>
		<p><tt>The relatively high price of [the] painting, which was originally expected to fetch about $60,000, is mostly likely because, unlike many paintings thought to be by Hitler, it came with a bill of sale, Ms. Weidler told Reuters. It also included a letter signed by Hitler's adjutant, Albert Bormann, apparently answering an inquiry from the Nazi-era owner about the painting's authenticity. "What I can make out from the photograph that you sent in, it appears to actually be a work by the F&#xFC;hrer," Bormann wrote.</tt></p>

	<h1>The Courtyard of the Old Residency in Munich (Der Alte Hof in M&#xFC;nchen, 1914)</h1>
	<p>Watercolour painting of The Alter Hof (<i>Old Court</i>) in the center of Munich. This painting is of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Hof">Alter Hof</a>, a stone quad in front of a large manor. Alter Hof is located in Munich, the capital and the most populated city in the German state of Bavaria.</p>
	<p>This painting and a few others are currently owned and archived in the basement of the Army Center of Military History in Washington, D.C., they are yet to be shown to the public due to their controversial nature.</p>

	<h1>Tree at a Track (Baum am Weg eines Sees, 1911)</h1>
	<p>In this painting, Hitler painted a tree that stands near the end of a woody track. Not really much is known about this, painting, but according to its <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Baum_am_Weg_eines_Sees.jpg">Wikimedia page</a> it was made by ex-Wikimedia user Jansiemering and first published on the 25th of July 2017, so in other words, Hitler was reincarnated as ex-Wikimedia user Jansiemering.</p>

	<h1>Vase With Flowers (Vase mit Blumen, c. 1912)</h1>
	<p>Stil-life painting of a blue jug with a bunch of flowers inside of it, this painting is somewhat unusual, as at this time, Hitler was mostly focusing more on landscapes and architecture. The painting is 34.3cm by 27.3cm.</p>
	<p>This painting was put on auction at the Nate D Sanders auction house on the 26th of March 2015, its starting price was $30,000 (or &#xA3;20,000), as expected the painting was sold and is now in the hands of a private collector.</p>

	<h1>House of Dr. Bloch (8th of May 1913)</h1>
	<p>Without context, this is just another painting by Hitler, however, with context this is quite a queer painting.</p>
	<p>This painting is of the house of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Bloch">Doctor Eduard Bloch</a>, who until 1907 Bloch was the physician of the Hitler family. Adolf was the first Hitler family member to have been seen by Bloch in 1904 when he became seriously ill and was bedridden due to a serious lung ailment. Due to this, 15-year-old Adolf was allowed to abandon his school career and return back home. However, after checking Adolf Hitler's files Bloch later maintained that he had treated the youth for only minor ailments, cold or tonsilitis and that Hitler had been neither robust nor sickly. He also stated that Hitler did not have any illness whatsoever, let alone a lung disease.</p>
	<p>What is even more interesting about this is a part of information you have yet been told: Eduard Bloch was a Jew.</p>
	<p>After nazi Germany's annexation of Austria in March 1938, life for Austrian Jews became much harder. After Dr. Bloch's medical practice was closed on the 1st of October 1938, his daughter and son-in-law, Bloch's young colleague Dr. Franz Kren (born 1893 in Austria, died 1976 in the US), emigrated overseas.</p>
	<p>The then 66-year-old Bloch wrote a letter to Hitler asking for his help, because of the letter, he was put under special protection by the Gestapo. He was one of only a few Jews in Linz with this status. He would stay in his house with his wife until they both moved to the United States. Without any interference from the authorities, they were able to sell their family home at market value, highly unusual with the distress sales of emigrating Jews at the time. Moreover, they were allowed to take the equivalent of 16 Reichsmark out of the country; the usual amount allowed to Jews was a mere 10 Reichsmark.</p>
	<p>In 1940, Bloch emigrated to the US and settled in the Bronx, 2755 Creston Avenue, New York City but was no longer able to practice medicine as his medical degree from Austria-Hungary was not recognized. Dr. Bloch would die in 1975 of stomach cancer at the age of 73, barely a month after Hitler's death. <a href="https://old.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=92083917">He is buried in Beth David Cemetery</a>, Section D, Block 3, Elmont, New York.</p>

	<h1>House by The Lake (Haus am See, 1910)</h1>
	<p>Painting of an unknown location that shows a calm scene of a house near a lake with mountains near the background. Just like <i>Tree at a Track (Baum am Weg eines Sees, 1911)</i>, the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hitler_Haus_am_See.jpg">Wikimedia page</a> says it was made by Jansiemering.</p>

	<h1>Mother Mary with the Holy Child Jesus Christ (1913)</h1>
	<p>The Virgin Mary is see holding her son, <a href="https://youtu.be/tgj3nZWtOfA?t=1m44s">Jesus Christ</a> in golden rays of light. Note that Jesus is not depicted in his usual brown haired way (or at least in his traditional Western image), but has blond hair; in other words Jesus looks like an Aryan (a term meaning people who have blond hair, are from European, and also have blue eyes, also known as the so-called "Master Race" that Hitler, and many others believe in).</p>
	<p>Despite Jesus Christ being the King of the Jews (as referred in John 19:3, <i>Then they said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck Him with their hands.</i>), Hitler did not believe that Jesus was Jewish at all, and that he was a "Aryan fighter" who struggled against "the power and pretensions of the corrupt Pharisees".</p>
	<p>It would seem that Hitler was apart of the <i>Positive Christianity</i> (German: <i>Positives Christentum</i>) movement. Positive Christianity differed from mainstream Christianity in that Positive Christianity:</p>
	<p></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Rejected the Jewish-written parts of the Bible (including the entire Old Testament)</li>
		<li>Claimed "Aryanhood" and non-Jewishness for Christ</li>
		<li>Promoted the political objective of national unity, to overcome confessional differences, to eliminate Catholicism, and to unite Protestantism into a single unitary Positive Christian church</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you wish to, you may read more about this bizarre movement over on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_Christianity">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

	<p>What is annoying is that this painting also shares the same name with the painting of the same name, but unlike the name-sake, this painting depicts more of a grizzly environment to the viewer; the lush blue skys have been replaced with a mud-like sky, the virgin green trees have been removed in favour of dark green, almost as if it was night.</p>
	<p>Despite this being a vile-looking painting, this artwork was picked up with the price of &#x20AC;391,000 (&#xA3;280,000) at the Weidler auction house in Nuremberg in June 2015.</p>
	<p>The story was picked up around the same time by Ben Knight, who works for the British daily newspaper, The Guardian, who wrote "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/21/hitlers-art-of-flowers-and-fairytale-castles-sells-for-280000-at-auction">Hitler&#x27;s art of flowers and fairytale castles sells for &#xA3;280,000 at auction</a>", in the article Knight writes;</p>
	<p><tt></tt></p>
	<blockquote>
		<tt>A view of Bavaria&#x2019;s famous fairytale castle Neuschwanstein brought the highest price of &#x20AC;100,000 (&#xA3;71,500) at the auction on Saturday [the 20th of July 2015].</tt>
		<p><tt><i>[...]</i></tt></p>
		<p><tt>According to the Weidler auction house, the bidders were investors in China, France, Brazil, Germany and the United Arab Emirates. Auctioneer Kathrin Weidler told DPA news agency: &#x201C;These collectors do not specialise in this painter, but have a general interest in high-value art.&#x201D;</tt></p>
		<p><tt>There is no law against the sale of Hitler&#x2019;s art works in Germany as long as they do not show any Nazi symbols, but press commentators have questioned the morality of allowing such auctions to go ahead.</tt></p>
		<p><tt>The Weidler auction house has previously defended the sale of Hitler&#x2019;s paintings on the grounds that they represented &#x201C;historical documents&#x201D;. In November 2014, Weidler also sold Hitler&#x2019;s painting of a Munich register office for &#x20AC;130,000 &#x2013; the high price was attributed to the original sales bill that came with it.</tt></p>
		<p><tt>In 2009, Mullock&#x2019;s auction house in Shropshire sold 15 of Hitler&#x2019;s paintings for a total of &#xA3;97,672.</tt></p>
		<p><tt>Few in Germany want to be seen making a profit from the Nazi dictator&#x2019;s work. The Bavarian state archive, which owns some of Hitler&#x2019;s work, has a policy of not paying for the works, but accepts them as donations in order to take them out of circulation.</tt></p>
		<p><tt>Last November [2014], the head of the auction house, Herbert Weidler, promised to give some of the proceeds of the sale of Hitler&#x2019;s Munich painting to charity, saying that if none accepted the offer, the local civic preservation society Altstadtfreunde N&#xFC;rnberg (&#x201C;Friends of the old city of Nuremberg&#x201D;) would be given the money.</tt></p>
		<p><tt>The chairman of the society, Karl-Heinz Enderle, immediately expressed surprise at the presumption that he would accept the donation, and told local media that he had no intention of taking it.</tt></p>

	<h1>Road to No Man's Land (1916)</h1>
	<p>An okay at best painting depicting the unoccupied no man's land. Note that a lot of the objects are drawn poorly such as the tank and the boxes.</p>

	<h1>Tank Patrol (1917)</h1>
	<p>Almost child-like drawing of a German tank on the move in a demolished town. Compared to other work by Hitler such as <i>The Courtyard of the Old Residency in Munich</i>, <i>St. Charles's Church in Vienna (Karlskirche, 1912)</i>, <i>Neuschwanstein Castle</i> and even perhaps <i>Standesamt M&#xFC;nchen</i> this work is rather bad, and looks rushed, admittedly he was fighting a war, but still without context it looks bad.</p>

	<h1>Alter Werderthor Wien (The Werder Gate, c. 1910-12)</h1>
	<p>Not much is known about this apart from that it's much better than 1917's <i>Tank Patrol</i> - anything is better than that.</p>
	<p>According to the now offline <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170207181701/http://www.snyderstreasures.com/pages/hartworks.htm">Snyder's Treasures</a></i>;</p>

	<blockquote>
		<tt>This painting depicts the Old Waterway in the old section of Vienna. There is a significant amount of cross-hatch shading marking some of Hitler's later Vienna work. The detail is outstanding throughout.</tt>
		<p><tt>This painting is accompanied by the original Peter Jahn provenance statement of authenticity dated May, 1972, Vienna. Peter Jahn worked for Hitler, relocating his paintings prior to the outbreak of WWII.</tt></p>
