			<h2>A Look At Deep Dream of Electric Sheep (2015)</h2>
			<em>Cass Python, 2018-10-12</em><br>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream"><em>DeepDream</A></em> is the name of a computer vision program that was created by Google's Alexander Mordvintsev, an engineer at the American company. The program uses a convolutional neural network to find, and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dream-like hallucinogenic appearance in the deliberately over-processed images out of an <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldschafe.jpg">old image</a>.
<p>
There is a new type of question that is on the minds of so many people working on AI computers; and that is <em>is</em> AI able to think, feel, and act on its own, as if it were a human? If so, then a second question should come up in relation to AI such as DeepDream; if an AI is indeed able to act as if it were a human being, does that mean that images such as <em>Deep Dream of Electric Sheep</em> are works of art?</p>
<p>
Or does the act of thinking about this idea not only trivialise artwork made by the greats, but also devalue us a humans?</p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
It is almost certain that in the very near future, this issue will likely effect not only the art world, but the world of what is right and wrong.</p>
