 <h1>A Bad Review of Solo: A Star Wars Story</h1>
<em>Cass Python, 2018-06-07</em><p>
I've never really been the biggest <em>Star Wars</em> fan out there, so I don't
 really see anything Star Wars related to be this holy cow that I love so much
 that I am willing to fall on my knees and suck off George Lucas in the middle
 of Liverpool, so for me when I saw <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> all I
 wanted to see was a good movie - how disappointed I would be.</p><p>
When I went into the movie, I had no idea what it would be like, I'd seen no
 trailers, no reviews for the movie, nothing, so I was going into the movie with
 an open mind. First off, I saw it in IMAX&#xAE;, and that was not a good idea.
 When watching the movie there was no point where I felt like there was any need
 to it being in 3D, or even that it was all that impressive, in fact, there were
 times when I felt bad for it being in 3D, like when the foreground was hard and
 fuzzy as if I needed glasses. I don't know if it's just me, but I really don't
 care at all for 3D movies at all, the only 3D movie that I feel like watching
 would be Mad Max: Fury Road.</p><p>
From watching the Red Letter Media review of the movie, it would seem that it
 didn't matter if I picked 3D or normal, as they commented on it by saying that
 <a href="//youtu.be/MmPPxQnaGDY?t=23m27s">the movie's lighting was really bad</A>
 a lot of the time, so bad that Jay Bauman (one of the cast on "<em>Half in the
 Bag</em>") had to look behind him to see if the projector was working as it
 should.</p><p>
One strange thing I couldn't help but notice is simply how many British accents
 there were in the film; it seemed like every other cast member was speaking
 with a British tone. I'm guessing this is due to it probably being filmed in
 the UK, or I just guess that in Star Wars the British just took over all of
 space with tea and bad teeth, <em>said the Brit</em>.</p><p>
Speaking of British people, one of the worst characters in the movie would have
 to be L3-37 (is that l33t?) the robot, whose only trait is that she wants equal
 rights for robots. This was so bad at times that I started to laugh to myself
 in my seat.</p><p>
There's even a point in the <span title="lul">talking picture</span> where she
 starts a robotic uprising on a slave planet in something even Douglas Adams or
 Monty Python would have felt was too unusual, but no, it's here in a Star Wars
 movie; robots jumping on a keyboard is in the same universe as millions being
 killed by a giant Death Star. Just amazing.</p><pre>

The movie's dialogue felt really forced at times, almost like it was taken from
 a new-wave Christmas play from a school. Early in the movie Han goes up to a
 desk to join the bad guy's army (I forgot the name of the bad guys in Star
 Wars, whoops), and when he's at the desk the guy asks him what his last name is
 and he says that he has none, the part goes something like this;</p><blockquote><tt>
<p class="blue">Man at desk: What's your name?</p>
<p class="green">Han: My name's 'Han'.</p>
<p class="blue">Man at desk: 'Han' what? Who are your people?</p>
<p class="green">Han: I don't have any people.</p>
<p class="blue">Man at desk: No people, hur? [thinks for a second] Han... Solo.</p>
</tt></blockquote><p>
What? Who gives a single shit about how Han got his last name? Why does it
 matter so much that the movie took the time in telling us how he got his name?
 That would be like if in <em>Rambo</em> they took the time in telling us how
 John Rambo got his middle name of "James", who cares? Just get to the action,
 this isn't a Wikipedia trivia article, this is a movie about a space robber and
 what fun things he does.</p><p>...</p><p>
In conclusion, would I recommend "Solo: A Star Wars Story" to anyone? Overall I
 would say that you should give this one a miss. Is it the worst movie of 2018?
 I don't think so, some parts of the movie are fun such as the train part, but
 sadly a lot of it is just dull, by-the-numbers story telling.</p><p>
I don't think this movie will be remembered in 5, 10 or 15 years. This movie
 made the crime of not being all that good, but at the same time not being
 really bad, it's just <em>meh</em> at best.</p><p>
To end this review I'm going to end it with a quote from <em>Critically
 Acclaimed</em>'s very own William Bibbiani; "Maybe some 'Star Wars' stories
 don't actually need to be told".</p>
