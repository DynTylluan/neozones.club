 <h1>A Bad Review of Yesterday (2019)</h1>
<em>Cass Python, 2019-08-25</em><p>
Perhaps one of Britain's biggest exports of the 20th century was her music and
 the many bands that came along with that, from rather clean bands from <em>The
 Shadows</em> to criminally over-looked artists such as <em>Dusty Springfield
 </em>. <img align=right src="yesterday_poster.png" alt="Yesterday poster" title="The poster for Yesterday is seen. Jack (played by Himesh Patel) is on the right holding a guitar, while Ellie (Lily James) is on the left. Both of them are behind a yellow background.">
 Indeed, if you are a firm believer in the concept of the cultural phenomenon
 that was the British Invasion of the 1960's, then you will no doubt at all know
 about <em>The Beatles</em>, Hell, if you have ever owned a radio set, you would
 have heard their songs countless times. <em>The Beatles</em> aren't a band that
 will be forgotten any time soon.</p><p>
That's why it is an interesting concept to wonder what would happen if they
 never existed, what would the world be like today? Well, as it happens, it
 would have a fair bit of comparisons to ours. <em>Yesterday</em> was directed
 by Danny Boyle (known for Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, Slumdog Millionaire,
 and 127 Hours) and written by Richard Curtis (known for Four Weddings and a
 Funeral, along with co-writing British classics like Blackadder, Mr. Bean, and
 The Vicar of Dibley).</p><p>
The movie, while fun and entertaining, overall didn't have all that much of an
 overarching threat. For example, in the <em>Star Wars</em> movies, Luke
 Skywalker needs to overpower the evil that is Darth Vader, but in <em>Yesterday
</em>, the <em>only</em> real threat is more of a concept that the <em>real
</em> Beatles, Paul and Ringo, will appear and destroy the world of Jack Malik
 (Himesh Patel of <em>EastEnders</em> fame), who got famous for technically
 stealing Beatles' songs from memory, after he got hit by a bus, went into
 hospital, waking up to realise that he was the only person to know who The
 Beatles were. Not the best or even strongest of plots ever, but the movie does
 get away with its tail between its legs, just for how likeable its characters
 were, and the appearance of fun music.</p><p>
While not normally not an actor, Ed Sheeran's presence was enjoying to see. At
 times his acting skills were not rather the best, but saying that, his skills
 in the field of acting did see an improvement later off in the movie. When Mr.
 Sheeran and Jack first met in the kitchen of Jack's parents, Sheeran did have
 an almost stiffness to them, but this was soon fixed while he was in the
 studio. Ed Sheeran in <em>Yesterday</em> did have an ore of charm to him and he
 did seem like a genuinely nice person, <em>of cause, he could be a complete
 bastard outside of the movies</em>, but that doesn't seem likely.</p>
<p class=center><img src="yesterday.jpg" alt="Jack on stage" title="Jack is seen on stage by a microphone holding his guitar."></p><p>
The parts of the movie that show the making of music, feel like they are trying
 to tell the viewer of the many downsides to the music world; even the process
 of making an album cover is heavily thought about in a board meeting with large
 numbers of <em>yes men</em>. Even simple things such as trying to make one of
 the albums called <em>The White Album</em> are changed in fear of implying that
 there was a race motivation behind it. A part of the movie even had Ed Sheeran
 and Jack's producer (as played by Kate McKinnon) inject their own ideas into
 the making of <em>Hay Jude</em>, suggesting to change the name from "Jude" to
 "Dude", as the name Jude is old and less hip. The movie seemed to like pushing
 the idea that the music industry as a whole is full of yes men and
 bastardisation of the original artist's ideas.</p><p>
All of the people, <em>besides Ed Sheeran</em>, in the music industry were
 portrayed as utter bellends with no spine. The manager (Kate McKinnon) for all
 intents might as well have been played by a secret love-child of Hitler, Fred
 West, and my old PE teacher, there was even a part very near the end of the
 movie where she, quite literally, screams "Stop in the name of money" - <em>not
 very subtle</em>, on reflection of the movie, I'm surprised that there wasn't a
 part of the film where the manager was seen drowning babies.</p>
<p class=center><img src="yesterday_when_you_poop_yourself.jpg" alt="Jack's interview" title="Jack is at a press conference that is about his new record, One Man Only. His manager (Kate McKinnon) is seen by him while people from the press are talking photos of him."></p><p>
On reflection, one thing that I liked was the comparison between the United
 States and the United Kingdom, where the US is all sunny, while the UK is wet
 and damp; quite funny.</p><p>
The movie was overall enjoyable and quite the fun to watch, plus, as stated, it
 has a number of music numbers that were nice to hear, even better was that they
 were covers, so Jack would add his own way of singing it, just a shame that the
 soundtrack on YouTube has background noise to it (like the character talking,
 even on the official audio), I did see a record copy of the soundtrack at the
 UK-based music and film retailer, HMV for sale, but it was around Â£40 - a <em>
 bit</em> too much, don't you think?</p><p>
The ending was a bit... <em>meh</em> at best, but I am glad that the reasoning
 why Jack is the only one to remember The Beatles is never explained at all so
 it leaves us - <em>the viewers</em> - wondering why. I personally think that
 Jack (and the other two people who remember the band) were sent to a parallel
 universe where the band (along with cigarettes, Coca-Cola&#x2122;, and Harry
 Potter&#x2122;) were never invented, but of cause, you're free to have your own
 idea about how it happened.</p><p>Good movie; worth a watch.</p></main>
