This issue we have:
* We have a new website!
* Nothing else, really
* Just check our new site out, okay?

-------------------------------------------------

>NOT MORE CRAP
Saluton, welcome to issue 17 of AcidMail! ðŸ™‚
Things can only get better from now on, we're
sure of that!

This week we have more fun of you to enjoy,
including looking at The Beatles' "Help!"... or
not seeing that I didn't have time to fully write
down what I thought of it... uh, we also have
more links, but that's nothing all that new... uh
I guess this is a short one.

-------------------------------------------------

>WE HAVE A NEW WEBSITE
: <a href="https://neozones.club">https://neozones.club</a>
Everyone at NeoZones is very excited to announce
that we have a new website that we want to show
off to you! Over the past months, we have been
wanting to move from our current host, Neocities,
to one that will allow us to do a whole bunch
more things, so that's why we bought a domain!

Yes, that's right, this is us making a call-out
post on our NeoZones dot club - Kyle Drake is a
bitch-ass motherfucker, he pissed on my fucking
source code! Gurr, gurr.

As of now, the new NeoZones is just a mirror of
our Neocities site, but we will of course be
adding new content to it all of the time, we also
have plans to re-do the layout of the entire site
(Oooo!), and we are also thinking of inviting
people to join us, meaning that we'll be even
more like a tilde (oh, also the Penny's Pages
Wiki has moved to our new domain).

Hope you enjoy the new site!

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

As taken from Douglas Adams' 1978 book, The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the Babel fish
is probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It
is a small, bright yellow fish, that when put in
the ear of someone, will allow them to hear any
language translated into their native one.

>CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!
They say looking at TV will turn your eyes
square, that never happened to anyone we know, so
we guess that it would be fine to also browse the
web for 23-hours-a-day, Hell, if it won't for us
browsing the web so much, how would we have found
all of these links? Got you there, mom and dad!

As posted by fraggle (who he himself is the
current head of the Chocolate Doom port), here is
a long forgotten but re-found movie originally
from the Doom Damnit! website, as dated
2000-04-17, meaning that as of this month, it is
now over 20-years-old!

you following them yet?), Personally Comfy (or

Oh goodie, this one has a description about
itself in the site's meta tags, meaning that I
don't need to write all that much; Net Art
Anthology is a site that was made to show the
"HISTORY OF NET ART FROM THE 1980S THROUGH THE
PRESENT DAY".

>CREDITS
Thank you to everyone who has helped in the
making of this newsletter and past issues.

: KENT NASSEN AND PETER WEIGHILL
The ASCII art font used at the top of the issue
is called "double.flf (FIGlet font)", originally
made by Peter Weighill &#x3C;<a href="mailto:stuce@csv.warwick.ac.uk">stuce@csv.warwick.ac.uk</a>&#x3E;
who seemly worked at the University of Warwick
in "Commodore 64 Services" (I think that shows
how long ago that was, then). The font was made
on 1994-03-15, then was converted by Kent Nassen
&#x3C;<a href="mailto:kentn@cyberspace.org">kentn@cyberspace.org</a>&#x3E; on 1994-11-24 - thanks to
both blokes!

The font was finally uploaded to <a href="http://patorjk.com/">patorjk.com</a>, as
linked below - again, thank you!

AcidMail would not be possible if it won't for
the cocky people over at NeoZones, one of the
