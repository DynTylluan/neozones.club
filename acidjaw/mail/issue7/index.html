>BE A HANDSOME ANIME BOI!
Are you so ugly? Women don't catch you? Do you
want to be so attractive to women, straight men
and people with weird fetishes? You would want to
stop reading this text as if it were part of an
informercial? If you had knowledge about
artificial intelligences, Deep Dream and other
stuff, surely you've already heard of pages like
Melobytes (https://melobytes.com/) or This Waifu
Does Not Exist
(https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/). And
just as we could hire a robot to write one of
the AcidJaw issues, you can become an anime boy
thanks to the technology and magic of machine
learning techniques! 

The process is as simple as breathing, just
upload a photo of your horrendous face, put your
email, they will not ask for your credit card
number or the three numbers on the back or the
expiration date of it, check your email in about
10 minutes and voila, your own photo of yourself
in kawaii version!

Warning: Despite the results, you will remain
ugly in real life.

>THE COMPUTER IS MY SOUL
Nicholas Fedorov is an American animator,
musician and artist who has gained notorious fame
and cult on the Internet thanks to his animations 
hat are very reminiscent of the three-dimensional
style of the 90s animations. The content of
Nicholas Fedorov has a great variety of topics,
some of them parody characters from existing
cartoons, and others present original concepts.
All his creations are fascinating due to the
level of authenticity that applies to the style
of animation, although some may seem them
terrifying due to the (possibly)
nightmare-inducing style.

One of his best-known animations is a music video
titled THE COMPUTER, originally released in 2015.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8wrT6J8sNo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8wrT6J8sNo</a>
<a href="https://archive.org/details/NicholasFedorovTHECOMPUTEROfficialVideo">https://archive.org/details/NicholasFedorovTHECOMPUTEROfficialVideo</a>

What makes Fedorov's content especially
interesting is his ability to recreate vintage
stuff that really shines, you know, the VHS
lines, the over-saturated look, the cheesy CGI
effects and the fact these videos look 25 years
out of date. Fedorov has been known to use old
computers and software from the 90's to create
is videos, and also uses an actual VCR toprocess
his videos for the vintage look.

Unfortunately, his videos has been found quite
rare recently, years ago he deleted his channel
and his social medias, either because some kept
using trendy words such as "autism and vapowave"
in his comments or because it wasn't the kind of
fame he expected, to the point that several might
have harassed him. Like any avant-garde artist,
he is a normal person in real life despite his
half-creepy content, and said on multiple
occasions that he has an interest in vintage CG
animation of the 90's, retro computers, anime,
programming, and classic video games.

Almost all of its content can now be found either
by looking in the deepest guts of the web, on
YouTube or simply in this nice link on
Archive.org, hopefully one day he will have
enough motivation to give us more of his message,
his aesthetics, his music and his art.

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

For this week, we have something we are very sure
everyone can relates with this one. In this
situation, we see an individual sitting on top of
a (possibly) ceramic piece, doing some daily
ritual that tackles his needs to release all his
impurities from his body. How long will be there?
Probably a few minutes if they are not on a Taco
Bell bathrooms...

>THE MOST EVIL WEBSITE EVER
What you are about to see is the worst of the
web, the most evil that has ever existed in the
entire history of the internet, run by an evil
corporation that plans to dominate human minds
and control their lives to become richer and more
powerful, they are behind the world elite that
controls the world, with evil intentions, with
enough capacity to destroy the lives of millions,
no, BILLIONS of people, worse than the holocaust,
worse than communist revolution, worse than any
natural disaster that can destroy entire cities,
entire societies, including humanity itself. They
control a very large part of the internet, nobody
has an escape, you can run but not hide from
them. In some future, we will be slaves of the
system, thanks to them we will be part of the
system, everything is connected, from reptilians
to jews, all part of a conspiracy that plans to
take control of humanity itself, and even
dominate the entire universe.

Enter at your own risk, whatever action you do,
what happens next will not be part of our
responsibility. Instead, better use DuckDuckGo.
