>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

The ASCII art for this week was

>WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE OF THE NOW
Wikipedia can be a great place to find
information on, and to prove this, we've found
the best (and most weird) articles on the site
for you to read. Every week a new article will go
here, so watch out!

MINCED OATH
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A minced oath is a euphemistic expression formed
by misspelling, mispronouncing, or replacing a
part of a profane, blasphemous, or taboo term to
reduce the original term's objectionable
characteristics. Some examples include "gosh"
(for God), "crumbs" (for Christ), "crikey" (for
Christ kill me), "darn" or "dang" (for damn),
"doggone" or "gosh darn it" (for goddamn), "heck"
(for hell), "gee", "jeez", or "Jiminy Cricket"
(for Jesus Christ), "feck","fudge", "frick",
"fork", flip or "eff" (for fuck), "coot" (for
cunt), "sharlookey", "shoot", "shivers", "sweet",
"shucks", or "sugar" (for shit), and "bushwa"
(for bullshit).

ideas by the NeoZone losers, check out their URL

credit, of cause!)
