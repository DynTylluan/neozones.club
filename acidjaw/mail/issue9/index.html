>THE BEST OF MUSIC

If you like weird music, then you might like
this, basally this old lady in the 1960s, who was
called Mrs Miller, made a pop record full of
covers of other songs in such an odd way.

It's certainly not the worst record I have ever
heard, but I won't like to replay it for a while.

While the Mrs Miller record was kind of bad crap,
a few months back I uploaded an album call "The
orst Demo Tape Compilation In The World Ever"
that is full of so many terribly-funny demo
tapes - it kind of reminds me of 'Don't Buy This'
by Firebird for the ZX simply because of how the
people made the end product did such a terrible
job.

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

As made by Vice Admiral Acker, here we have a
nice little spaceship, hopefully about to blow up
the Earth, then we won't have to read anymore of
this terrible newsletter, oh joy!

>CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!
They say looking at TV will turn your eyes
square, that never happened to anyone we know, so
we guess that it would be fine to also browse the
web for 23-hours-a-day, Hell, if it won't for us
browsing the web so much, how would we have found
all of these links? Got you there, mom and dad!
