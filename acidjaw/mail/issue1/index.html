NEWSLETTER: Cold As Ice, Hot As Piss
<a href="https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue1">https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue1</a>

This issue we have:
* Let's hack 1990 websites!
* AAAAAAAAAAAAA, aaaa, AAAAA, AAAAAAA, aaAAAAA!
* Plus some cool links!

-------------------------------------------------

>WELCOME
Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the first
real addition of A C I D M A I L! Oh yeah, baby!

Hopefully you do enjoy this terrible idea, if
not, well it *is* free, so why don't you send a
letter into your local politician, telling them
how bad this newsletter is? I'm sure they will
really care about it.

-------------------------------------------------

>HACKED WEBSITES
Thanks to the fact that we browse The Internet
Archive's very own Wayback Machine, we sometimes
stumble upon a goldmine of the past, this time is
no exception at all.

AcidMail's head editor stumbled on a website by
someone calling their-self THC, who around 1998
started to archive and mirror websites that were
hijacked, and their site being mess-up in some
way.

Of cause, most of these websites that were hacked
were all from the late 90's or mid-00's, so it
really is a thrill to see what some l33t hack0rz
were doing at the time - very web 0.1, very in,
oh yes, very hip. 

Big shout out to such mad lads as \\StOrM\\,
Power Through Resistance, H4G1S, Circle of
Deception, No|d Crew who all hacked into some
sort of government body or the like.

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

For this week, we have some a nice little ASCII
art of some airmail dropping down, hopefully this
never happens to you, or you might need to have
a nice trip to the hospital. Owie.

>WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE OF THE NOW
Wikipedia can be a great place to find
information on, and to prove this, we've found
the best (and most weird) articles on the site
for you to read. Every week a new article will go
here, so watch out!

SPITE HOUSE
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A spite house is a building constructed or
substantially modified to irritate neighbors or
any party with land stakes. Spite houses may
create obstructions, such as blocking out light
or blocking access to neighboring buildings, or
can be flagrant symbols of defiance. Because
long-term occupation is not the primary purpose
of these houses, they frequently sport strange
and impractical structures.

Spite houses are considerably rarer than spite
fences. This is partially attributable to the
fact that modern building codes often prevent the
construction of houses likely to impinge on
neighbors' views or privacy, but mostly because
fence construction is far cheaper, quicker, and
easier than home construction. There are also
similar structures known as spite wall or
blinder wall.

>UNTIL NEXT TIME
AcidMail would not be possible if it won't for
the cocky people over at NeoZones, one of the
worst s0-called "webhome". To browse more bad
ideas by the NeoZone losers, check out their URL

probably put it on the next issue (with
credit, of cause!)
