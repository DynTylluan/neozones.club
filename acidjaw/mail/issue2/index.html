* Getting The Beatles really wrong

>Hello!
Yes, welcome to the second addition of AcidMail,
the weekly problem we all need to try and kill
off.... somehow... Remember, the only way of
killing such an evil force is to keep yourself
subscribed to this newsletter, and to get more
people to subscribe to it. Oh, and only cowards
have the audacity of unsubscribing!

>MANSON AND THE BEATLES
The absolutely dog-shit Beatles' interpolations
by Charles Manson. Most of his interpolations are
about how The Beatles are singing about Jesus
Christ, the upcoming race war between the white
man and black man, and just other crazy shit.

My personal favourite interpolation is what he
thinks the song Blackbird is really about. To
quote the article; Manson thinks the song is
about "The black man is going to arise and
overthrow the white man. The Beatles are
rogramming blacks to rise", while in reality, the
song is about a black woman's, who is in what was
the current racial tensions escalating in the
United States in 1968. In British slang, a "bird"
can mean a woman, so "blackbird" would just mean
"black bird".

One of Manson's more infamous terms was the
Helter Skelter scenario, much like Blackbird,
this was about how the blacks and whites would
fight. The lyric for the song go "When I get to
the bottom I go back to the top of the slide /
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride",
Manson seemed to think that this meant it was "A
reference to the Family's emergence from 'the
Bottomless Pit', the underground Death Valley
ideaway where the group will escape the violence
of Helter Skelter", and that the line "Look
out... Helter Skelter... She's coming down
fast... Yes she is", meant that the upcoming race
war could not be stopped, and was indeed going to
occur. Of cause, in reality, this race war would
never happen, and the song "Helter Skelter"
likely didn't have any deeper meaning than it
being about a helter skelter, an amusement ride
with a slide built in a spiral around a high
tower.

There are a lot more interpolations listed on
this page, and it is well worth a look, as it is
a mix of crazy and quite interesting.

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

Beep boop, this week's ASCII art is of a
wizard, who by the look of things, is brewing
up a nice pot of hot piss, mmmm, good stuff...

>CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!
They say looking at TV will turn your eyes
square, that never happened to anyone we know, so
we guess that it would be fine to also browse the
web for 23-hours-a-day, Hell, if it won't for us
browsing the web so much, how would we have found
all of these links? Got you there, mom and dad!
