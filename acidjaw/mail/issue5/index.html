>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

The ASCII art of the week goes to a little Zulu
tribesman as made by azc, I wonder why they look
so angry...

>CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!
They say looking at TV will turn your eyes
square, that never happened to anyone we know, so
we guess that it would be fine to also browse the
web for 23-hours-a-day, Hell, if it won't for us
browsing the web so much, how would we have found
all of these links? Got you there, mom and dad!

:OLD FURRY CONS
:<a href="http://www.fsun.net/blue_heel/conpics.html">http://www.fsun.net/blue_heel/conpics.html</a>
Here is a site that had a good amount of old
photos from furry cons from 1998 to 2005. There
is a good amount of what would be considered to
be "cursed" images on this site. Here is one of
<a href="http://www.fsun.net/blue_heel/images/ME&#x26;SP1.jpg">http://www.fsun.net/blue_heel/images/ME&#x26;SP1.jpg</a>


:THIS SITE IS DEDICATED TO VELMA DINKLEY
:<a href="http://www.velmadinkley.com/">http://www.velmadinkley.com/</a>
Seemly a whole site dedicated to "most
under-appreciated member of Mysteries Inc", that
being Velma Dinkley. This is a really odd
experiences, as this site's contents was last
updated in 2017, so you think "oh, this is a joke
to make a website look like it's old", but no, if
you chuck the URL in the Internet Archive, you
will see that it has been going since 2002. A
whole website dedicated to Velma Dinkley from
Scooby Doo since 2002. This is insanity.

There's a fanfic part to the site, there's an art
page, even a "Velma Chat", an IRC-like room where
you can "chat with other fans of Velma!" - ???

Honestly, you kind of need to give some credit to
the webmaster, keeping this site up since 2002 is
quite something, and most people probably would
not be able to keep a site updated for so many
years.


:HITCHHIKING
<a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hitchhiking">https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hitchhiking</a>
A very long and honest guide to how YOU can
hitchhike around the globe. Seemly not many
people know about Wikivoyage, but here it is.
Funny that it is a bit unknown, it is a sister
roject of Wikipedia, but hey-ho, what you goin'
to do?

>UNTIL NEXT TIME
AcidMail would not be possible if it won't for
the cocky people over at NeoZones, one of the
worst s0-called "webhome". To browse more bad
ideas by the NeoZone losers, check out their URL
over at: <a href="https://neozones.club">https://neozones.club</a>

Do you have anything that you want to see in next
week's issue of AcidMail? Is it a link, a
comment, a short story, or some art? Well
whatever it is, E-Mail it to us, and we will
probably put it on the next issue (with
credit, of cause!)

If you have any questions, comments, or anything
in between, please don't hesitate to E-Mail us!

Oh, NeoZones also has an official anthem, so
check that out, I guess...
