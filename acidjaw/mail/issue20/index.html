>A BAD REVIEW OF: SPACE JAM (2021)
: <a href="https://owly.fans/nightfall/003/">https://owly.fans/nightfall/003/</a>
: <a href="https://owlyfans.neocities.org/nightfall/003/">https://owlyfans.neocities.org/nightfall/003/</a>

Currently, on Letterboxd this movie has a sweet
score of 2.1 and I can sadly see why this movie
is so low on there.

I saw this movie in a theatre with my friends,
and when I went I was expecting it to be
something on the lines of so-bed-it's-good, sadly
this movie was just so bad and dear I say that it
was my least favourite movie that I saw in 2021?

This was just a drag to watch, even with a bunch
of my mates who are normally able to bounce off
a bad movie and make it entertaining, but even
with a group of people who are good at making fun
with each other, this movie gave us nothing to
bounce off of, nothing interesting happened - it
was just a slow slog of LeBron James (or "King"
as the movie kept on calling them) doing nothing
interesting, even when there was a whole
selection of fun cartoon characters that would
have made the movie a whole lot more fun.

Sure, I can see if you like movies where the cast
pat the back of one person, then this could be a
lot of fun, but for me, all it was was just
Warner Bros. showing off, practically telling me,
the moviegoer, "Hey remember THIS? Yeah, that's
right, you've seen Mad Max! Yo, look, it's
Clockwork Orange! Crazy, lol, oh hey, it's Penny
The Clown!" - who was this movie made for?

A lot of this movie just sadly seems to me to be
a shallow attempt to get a reaction from the
viewer by showing them movies and IPs that they
will hopefully have some attachment to.

When the gang gets back together, there is a
scene where Yosemite Sam is in the movie
Casablanca - What an odd choice of a movie to
pick; why make a reference to that movie of all
things? Kids aren't going to sit there and get
it, I can get a scene about Batman and Superman,
kids know those two, they are those cool guys who
punch baddies in the tits, they are cool, but are
kids, who are sitting through a U for Universal
movie (in the UK, as raised by the BBFC), really
going to get a Casablanca reference?

There's also a part of the movie that shows a
clip of Austin Powers with Elmer Fudd inside of
it, my God, is it the 1990s again?

Both movies came out in 1942 and 1999
respectfully.

In this movie, I just wanted to see some dumb
action with the Looney Tunes acting like dumb
cartoons, simply fighting and dicking around with
each other like in the classic cartoons, not some
boring scenes about LeBron James' family affairs,
if I wanted to watch something to do with family
affairs, I would turn on Eastenders and not pay
&#xA3;7.50 (10.43 USD as of 2021-08-03) on a crap
sequel that shoves adverts, not only to do with
other Warner Bros. IPs, but also other ones like
Nike and Converse.

One thing that I will give credit to is the
animation, which I liked for the most part, and I
rather liked how they would change it up every so
often (I especially liked the comic book style
that Lola Bunny had), as well as mixing in
cartoons with the real-life at the very end (oh,
if only there was more of that where say, Bugs
and Daffy would get to react to our world and not
be in a dull sequel), although that must have
only been for less than a minute.

Another thing that I didn't like about this movie
was the whole game dev part of it, which was just
bad and pointless. I don't know why it was even
there, I can guess that it was put there as a way
for children to project themselves onto Dom James
(played by Cedric Joe), but it was just, again,
pointless and did nothing but make the film even
longer than it should have been.

If I had full control of the movie, I think I
would have given Dom James so much more of a
smaller role.

To sum the movie up in one word, and this really
hurts to say, I think I would describe the
overall vibe as just "boring". I was just bored
throughout most of this film - I would not
recommend this movie to most people, at most I
would go on YouTube in a few years or so and find
clips of the film that is of just the animation,
but even then I would say that you should watch
those clips with a person who is good at bouncing
off of things and can bring out a good laugh in
you.

Sadly, you should avoid this one.

>MORE ART - DOG ADDITION
In the words of American poet Ogden Nash's 1941's
An Introduction to Dogs:

    The dog is man's best friend.
    He has a tail on one end.
    Up in front he has teeth.
    And four legs underneath.

: WHIPPET BY WALTERNOODLES
: <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/36964089/">https://www.furaffinity.net/view/36964089/</a>
I currently own two whippets (or at least whippet
is in their blood) so I can say with authority
that whippets are indeed very long and indeed
very fast little things that just love to jump
into a warm bed with you when you're trying to
sleep.

This particular one is very nice looking, all
purple and whatnot, plus the artist is selling
the piece for $15, so I guess if you like it, you
should support them.


: BAD DOG
<a href="https://sfw.furaffinity.net/view/42849593/">https://sfw.furaffinity.net/view/42849593/</a>
Cool MS Paint-like drawing - I always like stuff
like this


: BELLA BY NIMURE
: <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/37491408/">https://www.furaffinity.net/view/37491408/</a>
Sad reminder that nothing lasts forever and
nothing can live forever - not even your darling
pets. Everything _will_ die in the end and there
is nothing that anyone can do about it at all.
It would be in vain to even try, mortal.

Nimure, the artist, writes &#x22;One of my family
members had to say goodbye to a much beloved
family pet, so I did a quick little portrait for
them. Bella was a good dog. &#x3C;3&#x22;.

Everything that is alive will die, so make the
most of it, I guess.


: SNARL BY BERNERI
: <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/36454078/">https://www.furaffinity.net/view/36454078/</a>
I have been aware of Berneri's art now for
sometime, but I never _really_ had a change to
fully share it apart form on places like the
NeoZones Discord Server (as linked at the
bottom), so now that I get to show-off some of
their stuff, I am quite happy. This particaler
one fuck fuck fuck fuck


: DOG BY WUFFE
<a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/33029745/">https://www.furaffinity.net/view/33029745/</a>
Yo, the DOG is a ROYAL?? Nice.

OVer the past however lomg, we have been
collecting loads of links that you should view
while browsing the WWW.

: BBC CULT - ROOBARB (AND CUSTARD)
: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030704093744/https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/roobarb/">https://web.archive.org/web/20030704093744/https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/roobarb/</a>

Ages ago, the BBC used to have a part on their
website called the BBC Cult Site, where a small
team would write mini-bios for many cult TV shows
like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Ghosts
of Albion (???), and Farscape (???), as well as
other very-non-cult shows like Blue Peter (the
longest-running children's TV show in the world,
being broadcast since 1958-10-16), Doctor Who
(well, I guess when the website was made, the
show _was_ kind of cult), and also The Simpsons
(I made this the second link as I know that more
people will take interest in this).

Another show, that I suppose _would_ be cult that
is indexed on the BBC Cult site is Roobarb and
Custard, a charming, now-former, BBC program
running from October to November 1974 (short-run,
huh?).

The show is worth checking out, if not for the
charm of the slightly (weird) vibe old children's
TV gives off, IDK man, just the overall feel of some
shows is... _off_, but hey, at least it has a mean
intro tune.
	
ANYWAY, check out BBC Cult :>

While on Discord one night, myself and my
friends were typing in random website names, and
well, one of them we decided to look up was
boobies.org, a website, that according to
WHOIS, has been around since 2000-01-16 - and no,
for those ScArEd of clicking on it, all the
website shows is just someone holding up a piece
of paper that says "Boobies please!
Thanks! &#x263A;".

And you know what? It just tickles me funny that
over 20-plus years of the web changing, here we
have a single website that has just stayed the
same, hell, it even looks exactly the same way
as it does now on its first save via the
Internet Archive!

You know, sometimes you just gotta sit your arse
down and watch a series of videos where a bunch
of people make their own Minecraft 1.0 server
(circa 2011) with the aim of trying to slay the
pandragon - it's a simple playlist, but it's a
joy to watch the little progress that the players
on the servers make and the rather simple world
that they manage to make in the time that the
world was up.

But anyway, the Unicode Consortium has announced
a bunch of new emojis that will be seen in your
dumb little iPhone, idk, I'm like 60-years-old,
shut up, kid.

Anyhow, some emojis that we will get will be
