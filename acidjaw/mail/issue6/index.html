NEWSLETTER: AI is Going To Kill Us All!
<a href="https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue6">https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue6</a>

This issue we have:
* Hide your women and children
* Run for your life!
* The humans are dead

-------------------------------------------------

>BEFORE WE FULLY START
So before you get to fully dip your toes into
this pool of off-colour liquid, this week's
newsletter was mostly not written by a human,
but by Talk to Transformer, a "modern neural
network completes your text", as built by Adam
King (@AdamDanielKing). Sorry if you don't
enjoy it as intended, but the next issue will be
normal, well, as normal as you can get for
AcidMail.

All text WRITTEN IN BLOCK TEXT was made by a
human, everything else is by the neural
network.

>THE BOT'S INTRO
WELCOME TO THIS WEEK'S ACIDMAIL, a new feature on
the  Web Fictions site in which we do monthly
roundups of new work for the growing community of
comics writers. Now we've started the collection,
we'd love your input. Our first round-up featured
an original short story, a new short story by
Joel Thomas, and  a new project from Mike Baron
( Catwoman: The Fan ). Which works do you find
to be the best new works from new comics writers
in the last six months? Let us know in the
comments below. As always, if you have something
you'd like us to include, or want us to revisit
something you've seen before in a future

6 Clean Monastery vs. Academy, Old Dreams, and
Real Academies Last week I focused on the main
issue of Monastery vs. Academy. Now I would like
to discuss some other interesting points from
the chapter.

7 Clean Socratic and Utilitarian Interventions
Like Socrates, the Theravada Buddhists use
philosophical questions to examine their own
practices and to help guide the Buddhist monks.
We must understand why a person might desire to
attain nibbana, and ask why people may prefer
different methods of attaining it. After all, all
Buddhists can benefit from the same benefits.
There are three aspects to that: (1) Life: To be
led to the non-conceptual ground of enlightenment
by a compassionate life. (Pûrvāda)

On the way to enlightenment, one takes refuge and
either obtains or assumes the practice of the
Dharma. One makes one's first two vows, namely
he vows of equality and non-discrimination
(Dharmachakra and Adhidhamma), in order to gain
the three cardinal paths, Dharmakāya, Mahāyāna
and Mañjāna. One makes the practice of the three
means of escape, namely their achievement,
pacification and eradication, which forms the
methodology for the practice of meditation.

The Practice of the Three Means of Escape

"Purify yourselves from all wrong thinking."

>ASCII OF THE NOW
THE ASCII OF THE NOW IS A WEEKLY THING WE DO
It is not technically limited in time or theme
to The Now.

(here is our The Now file in chronological order)

I've been a regular contributor to the magazine
since the beginning of it. You can reach me at
any time with any question, comment or correction
or how you think the magazine could be improved.
If you have more input...

HEY LOOK, IT'S A LITTLE ASCII ROBOT to show off
at school."

Who'd pay a computer engineer $400 to program a
toy robot to look like a simple "Alex" sticker?
No one. So they coded their own.

These are 3D printable units that can be worn as
an avatar and constantly be updated to let you
play with your own avatar. They're so simple that
you'll find it impossible to want to leave them
behind when you're bored. All you have to do is
calibrate them by pressing a button on the side
of the unit. They're Bluetooth-enabled, so you
can control them remotely. This is huge.

This means you can never go hungry again.

There are now over a dozen such robots on the
table, and more coming in.

Robots that are not pure replacements for human
workers may help reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing.
In 2010, the proportion of manufacturing jobs in
the country was 5 percent, compared with 37
percent at the end of the previous decade. If
these jobs are now no longer good enough to get
people into the middle class, robotics will allow
them to be done without the human beings at all.
And this may do more to rebuild America's middle
class than any other program.

As soon as they arrive, it won't matter how they
are used. However robotic or not, all robots are
useful—but not always for what they are
specifically designed to do.

>CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!
THEY SAY LOOKING AT TV WILL TURN YOUR EYES to
glowy dots.

Vim is a computer programmer, and in the '70s, he
studied psychology at Cornell and began
programming. His first tools were, among other
things, a pencil and a small typewriter.

"In the beginning, I'd use different colors to
program the thing, and all of the computers were
'read only' and every other computer program was
just an array of stuff on the screen."

That was in 1977.

"Eventually, it became, 'That looks nice and
colorful and kind of arbitrary. Can we make it
into words?'"

What were some of the things he made?

"The original language that I learned was a
little like FORTRAN-like." Mr. Carrier's engineer
friend Matrangel, who had turned engineering into
a business, the "innovation economy," the
computer industry's answer to the East Coast's
recession, had taught him "so many rules,"
including, "Never put two of the same kind of
answers in a row. Never write the code to prove
the logic." "Having multiple answers is never
llowed." Mr. Carrier was encouraged by this. He
was working on his first software with engineers
specializing in functional-programming
principles. "It's more straightforward to write
than anything else," he says.

Mr. Carrier wasn't the only programmer to start
writing within the constraints. Computer science
Professor Michael Paterson, at Oxford, says a new
range of algorithms and larger devices would make
"small is beautiful". But Apple should stick to
he iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as the ultra-thin,
light-weight devices are an obvious choice, he
says.

A smaller iPhone also has the potential to do
good for the environment because it would be less
damaging to leave charging devices in power
outlets during long days in the office, says Asif
Akbar, of Columbia University in New York. Apple
is becoming one of the most carbon-intensive
companies in the world by tapping the power of
its mobile devices to power industrial processes
in factories and factories, he says.

Apple and other industry leaders such as Google,
Facebook and Alphabet - Amazon's parent - are
concerned about their own privacy and security,
mainly for personal use by consumers, but also
for use by businesses that don't yet have their
own security protocols. These companies are also
working to ensure that they have systems to share
data with those with similar use habits.

Amazon had previously rejected a version of the
Senate bill that would have required Internet
service providers and other companies to obtain a
warrant for their records to be accessed, and
only disclosed that data if a person "has a
reasonable expectation of privacy."

The issue now is in a trade committee, but any
changes that fall short of the Senate proposal
ould be used by industry trade groups to kill any
legislation.

I HAVE JUST FOUND-OUT ABOUT A NEW BAND CALLED THE
BEATLES of Impressionist Photographs . Here is
their website-link to their site... 1- It
consists of an impressive roster of 40 artists
(including 53 modern European composers), who
have now been recognized through an exhibition
that will open this March at the Art Museum of
The Hague in the Netherlands. 2- The exhibition
features some iconic images that display these
composers' complex influence on the creative
culture. I suppose that their work will be
exhibited in the same place that their
antediluvian Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band was exhibited in. So, definitely a good
weekend. And, obviously, I've already seen their
brilliant film Peanut Butter Jelly Time . 5

ACIDMAIL WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE IF IT WON'T FOR
THE COCKY PEOPLE OVER AT NEOZONES who would
prefer to do things their own way and is with
old groupies that don't really listen to what's
going on.

Big thanks to the PR department that helped us
