Hello there, welcome to the first ever AcidMail

newsletter that anyone is free to sign-up for. If
you have not yet done so, you can receive the
weekly problem by harassing OwlMan via their
E-Mail: &#x3C;<a href="mailto:owlman@protonmail.com">owlman@protonmail.com</a>&#x3E; (keep in mind
that you will be sending an E-Mail to a human and
not a bot, so try and say something funny or
witty), once you do that you will start to get
the new issue, every week!!

-------------------------------------------------

>JON
Neocities' very own OwlMan has decided to take it
upon their-self to not only clean up forgotten
Jim Davis comic strips, but also add color to
them also. For the month of August and a few days
in September, OwlMan will be posting his cleaned
up versions of Davis comics that had not seen the
light of day for 40 plus years.

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

This week's AoTN is of the big man himself, The
Devil on his computer. The likelihood is that his
broadband connection is 100 times better than
anything Concast could do.

>WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE OF THE NOW
Wikipedia can be a great place to find
information on, and to prove this, we've found
the best (and most weird) articles on the site
for you to read. Every week a new article will go
here, so watch out!

RUTH BELVILLE
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Elizabeth Ruth Naomi Belville (5 March 1854 â€“ 7
December 1943), also known as the Greenwich Time
Lady, was a businesswoman from London. She, her
mother Maria Elizabeth, and her father John
Henry, sold people the time. This was done by
setting a Belvilles' watch to Greenwich Mean
Time, as shown by the Greenwich clock, each day
and then "selling" people the time by letting
them look at the watch and adjust theirs.

>UNTIL NEXT TIME
AcidMail would not be possible if it won't for
the cocky people over at NeoZones, one of the
worst s0-called "webhome". To browse more bad
ideas by the NeoZone losers, check out their URL
over at: <a href="https://neozones.club">https://neozones.club</a>

Do you have anything that you want to see in next
week's issue of AcidMail? Is it a link, a
comment, a short story, or some art? Well
whatever it is, E-Mail it to us, and we will
probably put it on the next issue (with
credit, of cause!)

See you next issue.</pre>
