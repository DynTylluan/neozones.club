>HOW IS THIS CRAP STILL GOING ON?
Not going to lie to you, fokes, but this issue
was written when I was *really* drunk, but
anyway, uh, yes, hello there my fellow rage comic
fans, welcome to yet more of NeoZones' rubbish
ideas; AciMail. My Lord, when will the ride end?
I want to get off the ride, I want to go home,
take me home, TAKE ME HOME, I WANT TO GO HOME.

Last week's issue of AcidMail was very kindly
made by Randy AKA TEHLEROY, so check that out,
NOW!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???

Uhhh, there is also other crap in this issue, so
keep on reading for more fun to come! Oh boy, are
you all ready???

-------------------------------------------------

>MORE LINKS???
Because we're off our tits on meth, the very...
"sexy", "awesome", and "cool" OwlMan has made a
big ass-list of all of the links that have been
seen on the newsletters, plus more that have
been posted on the NeoZones Discord server, oh
joy, thank you, OwlMan, you are so great, and
kind, and nice, oh I love you so!

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

ASCII of a flamingoe, jgs, who made the art,
writes "In the fall of 1998, I saw hundreds of
flamingoes in the south of France. (There were
even more mosquitoes, but that's another story.)
Very few of the flamingoes looked like Joan's
flamingo".

>CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!
They say looking at TV will turn your eyes
square, that never happened to anyone we know, so
we guess that it would be fine to also browse the
web for 23-hours-a-day, Hell, if it won't for us
browsing the web so much, how would we have found
all of these links? Got you there, mom and dad!

: DEAR PHOTOGRAPH
: <a href="https://dearphotograph.com/">https://dearphotograph.com/</a>
Is a nice blog-like-thing where people dig up
their old photos, find the location of where they
were taken, then - finally - take a photo of them
holding up the first photo. The site is full of
nice little moments in time of people who have
now grown up, or are no longer around. Worth a
look.

: FLOPPYSWOP
: <a href="https://www.floppyswop.co.uk/">https://www.floppyswop.co.uk/</a>
Full of loads of crap from the past that can fit
onto a 1.44meg High density floppy disc, LOOK AT
THE SITE NOW, MORTAL!

: TELEHACK
: <a href="http://telehack.com/">http://telehack.com/</a>
Pretend that you're a hack0r with this website by
looking at the weather.

: CYBERMUD
: <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~rei/GAME/intro.html">http://www.mit.edu/~rei/GAME/intro.html</a>
Remember MUD games, granddad? Well here is am old
HTML game made around 1994; it's old, but it
certainly has charm.

: PIZZA ON TILDE.CLUB
: <a href="http://tilde.club/~pizza/">http://tilde.club/~pizza/</a>
By demand of Pizza Squeeze, here is his site,
there is nothing on it, but I know he will be
surprised to see it on here.

: SPAGETT! THE GAME
: <a href="http://www.ilovespagettgameyouhavebeenspooked.com/">http://www.ilovespagettgameyouhavebeenspooked.com/</a>
Let your dreams be real. Play the spagett game.
