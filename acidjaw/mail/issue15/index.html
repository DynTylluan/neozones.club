Welcome. Welcome to AcidMail 15. You have chosen,
or been chosen, to relocate to one of our
(finest) newsletters. I thought so much of
AcidMail that I elected to establish my edition
once again here so thoughtfully provided by Our
Benefactors, and so, whether you are here to
stay, or passing through on your way to parts
unknown, welcome to AcidMail 15. It's probably
safer here.

>"WE'VE GOT PONIES"
Some issues ago I presented you with some online
neural networks tools and I recently discovered
this wonderful site, so I thought: why not? Of
course if you were wondering how I made the
G-Man speech with Pinkie Pie voice, this tool
here lets you generate custom voices phrases
from characters of popular series like Portal,
MLP, even Dr. Who, using multiple audio
synthesis algorithms and customized deep neural
networks, something like Loquendo or Vocaloid but
with AI technology. This fun app is perfect for
killing the boredom spending hours and hours
listening to your favorite characters saying
things they would never say, depending on how
sick your mind is.

Here's an audio example courtesy of OwlMan from
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org">https://owlman.neocities.org</a>, proud editor of
AcidJaw and also member of NeoZones,
demonstrating the capacity that the application
can generate, keep in mind that this was edited
by a third party program to combine several clips
in a single audio.

The idea was to recreate series one episode one
of Red Dwarf, where David Lister (Pinkie Pie),
gets frozen in time.

>"A RED LETTER DAY"
From the darkness of oblivion, after almost two
years of being inactive, Penny's Pages will
return once again in its new official relaunch!

Starting 04-13, I mean yesterday, the only
(for now) source of information about everything
on Neocities will be back, now with a new and
comfortable design, thanks to the people who
brought you NeoZones and AcidJaw.

The site has few articles for now, but over
time it will grow much more, even after all
the events that have happened in these years
in Neocities, in a matter of months it will
be rich in content.

Also, we are looking for editors who can add
new articles related to Neocities, both about
users and elements and events of the site.

We know that last week this was published, but
since I will still be offering very cheap
commissions, you still have the opportunity to
take a masterpiece made by me for a very
economic cost. You would help me with my costs
in life, and I will help you with any wish with
any drawing you like.

Don't be the only loser who doesn't own
something good like this, be the envy of your
friends now!

If you still have doubts, check my gallery and
tell me, my contact information is on the same
website.

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of
forgotten websites, finding ASCII art that time
forgot.

This piece was made by Blazej Kozlowski AKA bug,
probably in 2005. This is just a 9mm Pistol,
used primary to kill Headcrabs, Metrocops, and
set fire to explosive barrels. A good stress
reliever for those times when you have to save
the planet from an alien regime.

>ANTICITIZEN ONE
I am going to drop some links that I found on
archive.org, which I found them very curious:

: ERIN'S TELETUBBIES PAGE
: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040930132019/http://www.angelfire.com/de/Tubbies/">https://web.archive.org/web/20040930132019/http://www.angelfire.com/de/Tubbies/</a>
: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/de/Tubbies/">http://www.angelfire.com/de/Tubbies/</a>
A site that pays tribute to Teletubbies, with
its own webring and fan club, the site still
stands today and lets you be
a World Wide Teletubby Fan Member!

: CODENAME: KIDS NEXT DOOR $1,000,000 TREEHOUSE
: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031205012005/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/shop/ultimate/ult/tre/ULT14KND1002.01.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20031205012005/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/shop/ultimate/ult/tre/ULT14KND1002.01.html</a>
This was real. In 2003. Cartoon Network
offered to sell the tree house from the
animated series "Codename: Kids Next Door".
If you have a time machine, enough money to
not mind spending on whims, and you have
problems with the adults, don't miss this
opportunity (The clipart child may not be
included).

: COM.GOOGLE
: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401123510/https://com.google/">https://web.archive.org/web/20150401123510/https://com.google/</a>
It's Google, but for people who type viceversa.

: THE FAKE NEOZONES
: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010519135702/http://neozones.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20010519135702/http://neozones.com/</a>
Who would say it? A bunch of nerds copied us
from the past! :)

>UNTIL NEXT TIME
AcidMail would not be possible if it won't for
the cocky people over at NeoZones, one of the
worst s0-called "webhome". To browse more bad
ideas by the NeoZone losers, check out their URL
over at: <a href="https://neozones.club">https://neozones.club</a>

Do you have anything that you want to see in next
week's issue of AcidMail? Is it a link, a
comment, a short story, or some art? Well
whatever it is, E-Mail it to us, and we will
probably put it on the next issue (with
credit, of cause!)

If you have any questions, comments, or anything
in between, please don't hesitate to E-Mail us!
