NEWSLETTER: I live... again
<a href="https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue17b">https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue17b</a>
<a href="https://wiki.neozones.club/index.php?title=AcidMail/issue17b">https://wiki.neozones.club/index.php?title=AcidMail/issue17b</a>

This issue we have:
* Old furry art?!?!?
* Speedruns?!?!
* URLs?!?!

-------------------------------------------------

&gt;WHY, HELLO THERE &#x1F44B;
Hello there, friends, welcome to issue 17B of
AcidMail, still one of the worst things to have
ever been made (yes, I know that you hate it
here, I hate it here also, but we might not need
to sit through this for very long).

This is a very special issue of AciMail made by
just Cass "Owly" Python as an attempt at trying
to get H Y P E around the possibility of
continuing AcidMail, but look -- we're jumping
the gun here a little bit, aren't we? So, what
*is* an AcidMail?

First started in 2020, AcidMail was the name of a
newsletter co-written by people that would be
published weekly on the 'net for the viewing
"pleasure" of you (yes, YOU!), the idea of the
newsletter was that it was not going to be like
most of the newsletters that you might subscribe
to as we have attitude, yo, and we will take open
jabs at the reader (we love you really XOXOXO)
while trying to stay light-hearted and trying to
ignore the, quite frankly, bleak news of the
world that was going on at the time.

The newsletter could be quite experimental at
times, such as with issue 6 that was mostly
written by Talk to Transformer, a neural network
that was made to try and complete text - another
example of noticeable things that we did was with
issue 13 where we got our readers to make
whatever they wanted to do in JS Paint, what was
at the time a fairly new webapp made to run like
MS Paint.

When the newsletter was first started, NeoZones
was quite the small community, being mostly made
up of people who were being hosted on the site,
however, since the newsletter stopped, a lot has
changed and we really have gotten out sticky
fingers in a lot of pies, and because of this, I
think that it could be worth a shot to try and
resurrect this newsletter. If you like the look
of this newsletter and think that you can help
with it, such as writing something for it or even
suggesting a link,
join <a href="https://neozones.club/discord">https://neozones.club/discord</a>

For a possible test run, we hope to show you what
AcidMail can be and we (uh, well *I*) hope that
you enjoy it a lot.

-------------------------------------------------

&gt;CHECK OUT SOME COOL ART, YO
As of late, Owly made the error of checking out
their old Twitter page and by doing so, she saw
a bunch of old artwork that they stared and
because over on at NeoZones we're all art nerds,
we thought that you - our very nice
reader - *might* enjoy some of the art that at
this point is a bit old, BUT WHATEVER, we can
link old art!

What are you going to do about it, huh? Call the
police like some kind of rat, eah, that's what I
thought.


: DOG IN THE RAIN
: <a href="https://twitter.com/3eyedog/status/1278260415743627265">https://twitter.com/3eyedog/status/1278260415743627265</a>
I (Owly) currently have two dogs that I love very
much, but from what I can guess from other
people, the term "wet dog smell" seems to be a
thing that people REALLY do not like. I don't
know if this is just me or not, but whenever my
dogs get wet, they don't _really_ smell all that
much, and trust me, they just _love_ to run
around in march-y and boggy pools - regardless,
the dog in this artwork made the right decision
of putting on a raincoat plus also has an
umbrella (very cute - I love it!).


: 9 BY CATBOOTS
: <a href="https://twitter.com/catboots/status/1145394581409808384">https://twitter.com/catboots/status/1145394581409808384</a>
catboots is an artist who just seems to pop-up
everywhere in the furry community (not that I mind), I
suspect that it's due to their cute art style that most
seem to love. A person who also seems to also love
their art (or at least this one) is my romantic
partner, Robin, who found the following art to be very
cute.

For myself, I liked COLOSSUS the best:
<a href="https://twitter.com/catboots/status/1134519918861275136">https://twitter.com/catboots/status/1134519918861275136</a>


: WHATEVER THIS IS BY CHARLES DAVIS

Charles Davis is a person who I just cannot pin
down; one moment they are taking selfies in
public toilets, the next they are writing books,
but one thing I am sure about is that Charles
seems to be a genuinely nice person (meaning you
should check them out!). Anyway, enjoy whatever
this is.


: THE PINK CAT ART-TRAIN

More furry artwork, because I can do whatever I
like, this time by OrlandoFox who brings us
fanart of the Pink Panther and Snagglepuss, two
cool cats


: PRINCE VS. PRINCE HARRY
: <a href="https://twitter.com/Jimllpaintit/status/1246112940786364416">https://twitter.com/Jimllpaintit/status/1246112940786364416</a>
Yep, it's art made by Jim'll Paint It, a UK-based
artist who has been making artwork in MS Paint
for... em... well a long time now, plus Jim has
published a few books with all of the silly and
fun stuff he has made in (that you should look
for and buy!).

This time Jim has painted The Artist Formerly
Known As Prince fighting Prince Harry while the
Queen tries to twat Freddie Mercury.

&gt;ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now (remember that?) is a...
a... ""weekly"" thing that we do that shows off
some (mostly) old art from the WWW that people
might not fully know or care all that much about.
Please enjoy at your own risk.

An interesting BBC article looking at the slowly
dying job of the forest fire lookouts, an
occupation that is as slow as it is important to
the country. The article itself has a fair number
of quotes from current lookouts that is very
worth reading. If you find yourself wanting more
on this subject, then Atomic Frontier made a
video about this very same thing and why it is
slowly dying out.

: Furry CD-ROM

I might as well show this off, but the other day
I found an open directory of old furry artwork
that I'm guessing was published circa 1998 via
CD-ROM!

There is some NSFW around on the directory, but
it is still interesting to see such old artwork
and how the whole ~V I B E S~ of furry artwork
has changed over the years since being
published, plus there are some known famous
furry artists that can be found here, such as
with Eric W. Schwartz, who is best known for
making Sabrina Online.

Looking at this art, it seems like this
CD-ROM must be dated from around 1996 or so.


: .ORG DOESN'T MEAN CREDIBLE

i DON'T KNOW HOW COMMON THIS- crap, I had caps
on again.

I don't know how common this is, but I guess
enough people were under the false impression
that all .org websites were a sign that the
information on it was credible. I'm guessing that
you, the reader, already know this, but it's nice
to be able to share this link around for when
someone less informed says something like this.

I'm guessing that this might have come around
thanks to Wikipedia being a .org site, but who
knows, either way, be in the know.

After not using MS Paint (or even anything to do
with Microsoft) for, God, over five
months, I, Cass Python, decided that I would draw
Xania the Linux fox girl, but it quickly turned
into me drawing an almost furry version of
Dracula, so I thought what the hell? Let's draw
Dracula, after all, they *were* a furry!

I was originally going to only draw this in
black, white, and red, but I thought it would be
fun if I were to make it so the only colors* that
I could use would be the ones found on the ZX
Spectrum, a British home computer
(<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zx-colors.png">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zx-colors.png</a>).

It's a little funky, but you know what, we need a
little funk in our life... or undead life! (wait,
are vampires undead??) Can you just imagine
someone walking down the street in these colors?
My sweet Lord, it would stand out.

As the colors are a little... strange... I
welcome you to feel free and edit around this
drawing and see if you can make the colors from
the ZX work better, or Hell, make some art USING
the colors, that would be really cool to see!

*I am sorry to my fellow Brits on here, but I use
American English online... I have failed you all.

Looking at how gamers (derogatory) are usually
better at being able to spot fakes in
speedrunning - nerdy read, but worth it.
