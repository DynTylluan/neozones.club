Hello!

While this issue of AcidMail has not been published, it will have images attatched to it, this is where the images will be stored - and yes, I have a PNG opamiser on them.

Hello everyone, in an upcoming addition of AcidMail https://jspaint.app/ will be one of the websites seen in the issue, and essentially, it would be cool if people were willing to draw something that they wanted too that could be used in the upcoming addition (this could end poorly)
