-------------------------------------------------

>PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT
Yep, it's time for your annual check-up, this
won't take long, sir, just pull your trousers
down, count to ten, and think of England, while
I do the rest; it won't take all that long.

Jolly good, sir! Oh, by the way, sir, for the
next issue of AcidMail, I'm forcing Randy to
write it, so let's see how well that goes...

Annnd all done, well, everything seems to be
fine, you can now read the rest of the issue
knowing that you are in tip-top condition.

>JS PAINT SUBMISSIONS
A few weeks ago, we asked you, the reader, to
make us some very nice art made with the online
art program, JS Paint. Here are some of the very
nice things that you have made for us, oh boy!

: THING BY EL
: <a href="https://encounters-ltd.neocities.org/misc/FRIEND.png">https://encounters-ltd.neocities.org/misc/FRIEND.png</a>
EL of <a href="https://encounters-ltd.neocities.org">encounters-ltd.neocities.org</a> was the first
to submit artwork for this little event. He
managed to create a fun little green blob and
seemly their bird friend - very nice. I
especially like the friendly vibe the whole image
has, good job, EL!


: TERRIBLE THINGS BY OWLY
: <a href="https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue13/saluton.png">https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue13/saluton.png</a>
Owly of <a href="https://owlmanneocities.org">owlman.neocities.org</a> made not one but two
horrible creations, the first being Saluton, that
shows the little gobshite in the middle of the
street, probably waiting for their dealer to
deliver their meth.

Later on, Owly would make another drawing, this
time a reminder to W A S H  Y O U R  H A N D S
: <a href="https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue13/wash_your_hands.png">https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue13/wash_your_hands.png</a>

This would soon follow to Randy of
<a href="https://tehleroy.neocities.org/">tehleroy.neocities.org</a> suggesting to Owly that
they should "Now draw coronachan hanging you
while saying 'you forgot to wash your foreskin'",
how romantic!


: TERRIBLE THING BY RANDY
: <a href="https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue13/wash_your_hands_2.png">https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue13/wash_your_hands_2.png</a>
As seen above, Randy suggested for Owly to draw
the embodiment of the COVID-19 virus essentially
bollocking Owl for not... wasting their
foreskin... Did we have to go *there*?

Anyway, click on the image link, I guess, oh, and
remember to wash... *sigh*... to wash under...
under your foreskin... (I'm sorry.)


: PIZZA SAVED THE DAY
: <a href="https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue13/untitled_4.png">https://neozones.club/acidjaw/mail/issue13/untitled_4.png</a>
Pizza Squeeze of <a href="https://squeeze.pizza/">squeeze.pizza</a> made a much more
wholesome finish to this art show. Finally we
have Pizza, who drew a (very much real-to-life)
self-portrait of himself.


With that out of the way, thank you to everyone
who took the time in drawing some artwork for
this event, you now now be set free.

>A LOOK AT THE BEATLES - WITH THE BEATLES (1963)
Exactly eight months after the band's debut of
Please Please Me, The Beatles were seemly back
for round two, this time with a new album; With
The Beatles. Unlike last time, the Feb Four's new
record is seemly more interesting than their
first dip into music, however, one of the things
that I will straight up say that I don't like
about the album is that, well, it could honestly
have just been called "Please Please Me Part Two"
as (hot take) it doesn't really show that the
band has grown all that much since their first
outing.

Well, that's kind of a lie, this time the band
have a more fast, quick record, let me explain;
'It Won't Be Long' is one of my favourite early
tracks by the band, as, unlike a lot of other
songs by the band in the early days (AKA Please
Please Me), the start of the song is as fast as
the chorus. In my opinion, the verses of a lot
of their songs (especially in the early days)
are slow and boring, while the middle parts are
fast and fun.

Thematically, well, it's the same as the last
record really, that being love and how nice it
would be if you were my girlfriend.

To be honest, if this review goes on any longer,
then it will just be the same as the last because
of how similar the first two albums by the band
are, so here are the stand out track that I like;

: IT WON'T BE LONG
Fast song; love the vocals and screaming the band
sings, for the first track, it's great, plus the
instruments all sound really good.

: ALL MY LOVING
Catchy as Hell guitar riff.

: LITTLE CHILD
An okay song, but still fun, probably my least
favourite favourite song. Worth a play, you might
like it, but you won't be missing much if you
gave this one a skip.

: TILL THERE WAS YOU
Rather sweet and simple song by McCartney, very
unlike 'It Won't Be Long'.

: PLEASE MISTER POSTMAN
Cover version of The Marvelettes. Yep, it's a
cover song, but a good one and is enjoyable.

: HOLD ME TIGHT
Good vocals and over-all a catchy song that got
me singing it to myself while I was working. The
lyric are rather simple and easy to remember, so
that deftly helps it, plus the clapping benefits
it out.

: I WANNA BE YOUR MAN
I would not be all that shocked if this song was
recycled from the pre-Beatles days. Still, fun
and enjoyable.

: NOT A SECOND TIME
More love songs, but a good one at that.

: MONEY 
With this and 'Please Mister Postman', I feel
like this song is covered all of the time. The
Beatles version is probably one of my favourite
versions of the song published, but never forget
the terribly-amazing Flying Lizards version from
1979. I'm not sure if I would have ended the
album with this song, maybe 'Till There Was You'
might have been a nice ending, but still an
alright ending to a better album then before.


Next time we have 'A Hard Day's Night', so
watch-out, it can only get better!

>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

ASCII of The Now is Cerberus, one of the many
Greek mythologies. In the stories, they are
referred to as the hound of Hades, having three
heads, and guards the gates of Underworld to
prevent the dead from leaving.

>CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!
They say looking at TV will turn your eyes
square, that never happened to anyone we know, so
we guess that it would be fine to also browse the
web for 23-hours-a-day, Hell, if it won't for us
browsing the web so much, how would we have found
all of these links? Got you there, mom and dad!

: BABY SHARK SAYS WASH YOUR HANDS
: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L89nN03pBzI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L89nN03pBzI</a>
Cute little animation by the people who made Baby
Shark, yay... Yeah, so what if this was made for
five-year-olds? I have been stuck inside for
over two weeks with no human contact.. Fuck
you, asshole... You know what, just get outta
my face.


: HIGHWAY TO THE GOPHER ZONE
: <a href="https://gopher.zone/">https://gopher.zone/</a>
'Highway to the Gopher Zone' is a "minimal
static-site-generated blog of write-ups and
resources for new users who are new to gopher",
that basally means that it has a collection of
small, detestable articles about the world of
Gopher, a protocol from the 1990s that is only
now used by a small amount of people.


: BBC ENTERTAINS THE NATION IN TIME OF NEED
: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/bbc-entertains-the-nation-in-time-of-need">https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/bbc-entertains-the-nation-in-time-of-need</a>
: <a href="/acidjaw/tech/links-we-like/">/acidjaw/tech/links-we-like/</a>
For all Britains stuck at home due to COVID-19,
The BEEB made a report on what programmes they
are going to show over the coming months.

Some things of note are that they are going to
air a show that has British cosmonaut Tim Peake,
who "will be chatting about how to keep your mind
active in period of self-isolation", they are
also going to show us a program that will be
about "stargazing with Dara Ó Briain in his back
garden and Chris Packham will be finding out
what is happening to our wildlife and how animals
will continued to be looked after", plus more
HIGNFY will be shown.

If you can't watch the BBC on TV, then we made a
collection of links that have been used on
AcidJaw plus have been posted on our Discord
server (second link).


: RED DWARF FANSITE
: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/smeghead/">http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/smeghead/</a>
As based off Red Dwarf, this website that was
seemly last updated around 2000, is rather small
and unfinished (or "undefined" as every-other
website hosted on Angel Fire would say) and has a
few now-dead links to other sites. Might be worth
a look if you like old fansites and that sort of
thing.


: NATURAL BORN KITTENS
: <a href="http://www.naturalbornkittens.com/">http://www.naturalbornkittens.com/</a>
: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090403075527/http://www.naturalbornkittens.com/">http://web.archive.org/web/20090403075527/http://www.naturalbornkittens.com/</a>
WebComic as made by a young Larry Bundy Jr that
is *somehow* still online (we linked an archived
version just in case). The site is VERY inspired
by Anime and the Eastern-world. If you click on
the "tell a friend" text at the very bottom, a
little pop-up shows up, encouraging the viewer
to mail the URL to a friend, writing that Natural
Born Kittens is "A British manga about  four half
cat half human demonesses living in Northwood
Middlesex..."
