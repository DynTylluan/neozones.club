>ASCII OF THE NOW
The ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing we do
where we dig threw the old archives of forgotten
websites, finding ASCII art that time forgot.

[ASCII goes here, make sure it fits!]

Write about the ASCII art you have found here.

ASCII goes here, make sure you credit whoever
made the art, buy browsing OwlMan's Who is Who in
ASCII Art page, and anchor their URL below, also
put a link to where you found the art from.

>CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!
They say looking at TV will turn your eyes
square, that never happened to anyone we know, so
we guess that it would be fine to also browse the
web for 23-hours-a-day, Hell, if it won't for us
browsing the web so much, how would we have found
all of these links? Got you there, mom and dad!

>UNTIL NEXT TIME
AcidMail would not be possible if it won't for
the cocky people over at NeoZones, one of the
worst s0-called "webhome". To browse more bad
ideas by the NeoZone losers, check out their URL
over at: <a href="https://neozones.neocities.org">https://neozones.neocities.org</a>

Do you have anything that you want to see in next
week's issue of AcidMail? Is it a link, a
comment, a short story, or some art? Well
whatever it is, E-Mail it to us, and we will
probably put it on the next issue (with
credit, of cause!)

If you have any questions, comments, or anything
in between, please don't hesitate to E-Mail us!
