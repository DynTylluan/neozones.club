			<h2>AcidJaw</h2><img align="right" hspace="15" src="iso_8601.png" vspace="5">
			From the very pits of Hell, where no mortal man dear place foot, comes one of the worst atrocities carried out by man; AcidJaw. Dance with the devil, sell your soul, and read AcidJaw. <em>Ohhh yeah!</em>
			<p>
			<em>AcidJaw</em> wasn't meant to be hip, cool or anything really, we're not going to lie to your face and some some rubbish like "We will bring you the latest events from across the world!" -- we're not like that. AcidJaw is made up of people who just want to bring you something interesting to read about. We're not connected to any big company or organization and because of that, it means that we don't need to worry about what some shitty shareholders say about what we report on. This isn't the second coming of Christ, this is AcidJaw.</p>
			<p>
			Because of the fact that we're not connected to any big company or organization, it also means that we're made up of people who simply run AcidJaw out of pure spite -- uhh, <em>enjoyment</em><tt>[citation needed]</tt> -- anyone is more than welcome to submit an article or two that they have made to AcidJaw, just simply harass the editor at: <tt>OwlMan &#x3C;<a href="mailto:owlman@protonmail.com">owlman@protonmail.com</a>&#x3E;</tt> and they will sort out the rest.
			<p>
			Thank you to <a href="https://neozones.club/">NeoZones</a> for hosting us and putting up with our BS.
