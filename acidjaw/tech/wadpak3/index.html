			<h2>Crap From The Past: WADPAK3.WAD (1994)</h2>
			<em>Cass Python, 2020-01-03</em><br>
Might as well share <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom/v-z/wadpak3">this crapware WAD for Doom from 1994</a> (so very early on in the life of the game) that goes by the very catchy title of "WADPAK3.WAD" by Gary Karnik, who writes in the README file "[t]his is my third attempt to take some of the best shareware PWADs for DOOM available and combine them together into reasonable new episodes, and for 1994, Karnik <em>might</em> have been fairly right, as the majority of PWADs (as in custom maps for <em>Doom</em> and its sequel) from the 1994 era <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/1994_level "><em>kind of won't the best</em></a> in terms of level mapping, I mostly blame this due to the lack of experience in making levels and also the tools to make said levels were basic and tricky at best.
<p>
The first few levels of the WAD can be ridiculously easy, all you need to do in the first three levels of episode one is to run around with a plasm gun, gunning down demons, in total, you might not even break the 30 second mark, while E1M5 can be finished under one second if you know what you're doing
<p>
The screenshot shows the start of E1M6, taken from a WAD called "UCA.WAD", a quite a fun map for the time, although it can be a bit of a mess at certain points; Hell one moment then the UAC labs the very next. Sadly due to it's generic name, I couldn't find-out who made the original WAD.
<p>

<p>
This particular map has its ups and downs, mostly downs due to how cramped the whole environment can be during the hell-ish parts, copy 'n' pasted rooms, also the starting area, while looking kind of cool, can be a bit confusing if you don't know what you're fully doing. 
<p>
In total, Gary Karnik would make four WAD packs; <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom/v-z/wadpak1a">WADPAK1a.WAD</a>, <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom/v-z/wadpak2">WADPAK2.WAD</a>, our <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom/v-z/wadpak3">WADPAK3.WAD</a>, and finally <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom/v-z/wadpak4">WADPAK4.WAD</a>. As RainboWarrioR saying in a review for WADPAK3; "these 'wadpacks' are really only worth the download for their historical value being technically the first '"megawads'".
