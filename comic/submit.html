Submit a Comic to Comic Ping Pong</h1><p>
So - you want to submit your sexy comic strip to Comic Ping Pong? Great job, but
 before you send us your strip, be sure it follows these guidelines:</p>

<ul><li>While making the comic page, think about this: does your page follow the
 plot of the comic or is it just random? If it <em>is</em> random, and doesn't
 follow the over-all story, then we probably won't accept it.</li>
<li>Try and make the comic that you are sending us semi-SFW. While making the
 page, think about this; would a normal person think that the page in question
 is okay to view by someone 13 or older? If not, then the page <i>might</i>
 get rejected depending on how badly it is pushing the boat out.</li>
<li>Try and put effort in the page; if it looks like it was made to troll, then
 it will be rejected, simple as.</li>
<li>Make sure that the page you send us is <a href="blank.png">582 by 248</a>
 for consistency's sake.</li></ul>

<dl id=cult><dt>Be sure to include the following information:</dt>
<dd>What name you want to be credited by.</dd>
<dd>Your site/dA/Tumblr/etc. to link back to.</dd>
<dd>When you made the page (<a href="//xkcd.com/1179/">ISO-8601</a> format).</dd>
<dd>A transcript of the page, for the vision-impaired.</dd>
<dd>Any author's commentary (programs used, what you're working on, etc.).</dd>

</dl><p><b>What kind of art style should I use?</b><br>
You can use <i>any</i> style that you like; 8-bit, 3D model, made in MS Paint,
 made in ASCII art, or even a photo that you took. <i>Anything</i> is more than
 welcome; you don't need to follow the style of the last page, do what you
 think is best!</p><p>

<b>Sending your page</b><br>
You can send your page in in a few ways;
 <a href="//neocities.org/site/neozones">post on our profile about it</a>,
 <a href="/discord/">post it on our Discord</a>, or
 if you have accounts on neither,
 <a href="mailto:owlman@protonmail.com">E-Mail OwlMan about it</a>.</p>
