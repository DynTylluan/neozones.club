</p><p><b>Description:</b> A man with no hair is seen looking at his brick wall.
 On the floor we see a fly. The text "There was a person smiling uncomfortably
 at his brick wall" is seen in the Andika font.
</p><p><b>Author's comments:</b>  [Note from OwlMan] I had to resize this image
 as I published the wrong size that the image should be on the site, this is
 100% my fault and nothing to do with jopp, you can see the unedited version of
 their page <a href="page2_large.png">here</a>.
