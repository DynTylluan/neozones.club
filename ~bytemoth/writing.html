<h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Making Stories That Are
Stories and Don’t Suck</h1>
<P>Before this gets
started and I am absorbed in my own genius or whatever, I just want
to say that everything here is either stuff I’ve discovered from
writing a bunch of stuff, or things I’ve inferred from reading a
bunch of stories. So know ahead of time that the words below are like
potatoes: you gotta take em with a whole buttload of salt because
they soak that shit up. If anything that follows sounds
authoritative, it’s only because I’m too lazy and/or proud to
sprinkle qualifiers between every other word. So here goes.</P>
<P>If you’re reading
this, it is probably too late to convince you not to write a story.
The best I can do is make sure the story you write doesn’t suck. If
we’re both lucky, what’s written here will actually result in
your story being good, but let’s not get our hopes up. Hope has no
place in good writing. Dogged persistence, yes. Hope, no.</P>
<P>So the very first
thing to be sure of when attempting to write a story is that you are,
in fact, writing a <I>story.</I> A story is a very particular type of
thing, and it is not to be confused with a character study, a
detailed snapshot, or an expression of pure feeling. There is nothing
less interesting than your feelings, except perhaps the feelings of
your characters. They are the means to an end, and a currency yielded
from and gained by the events in your story, and as such only
interesting as a product of more interesting things.</P>
<P>See if you can
recall a time when someone told you a story that totally amazed and
enthralled you, despite the fact that the person speaking was an
awful storyteller. Maybe they stuttered, maybe they mumbled and
forgot details, but you still found yourself intent on knowing what
happened next. The strength of the story itself trumped all other
factors. What you are trying to do, at the core, is construct a story
so compelling that good writing cannot help but follow from it. Bad
word choice and grammar are much much easier to revise than a bad
story.</P>
<P>Ok so to be simple
with it, what I think separates a STORY from all those other stupid
things I mentioned above, (and this is a pretty wide definition.
Maybe I’ll come up with a more narrow one later to suit my
purposes) is this:</P>
<P><I><B>A story is an
account of change.</B></I></P>

<P>That’s basically
what you’re doing in any good story. Frodo Baggins changes from
unassuming hobbit, to adventurer, to scarred veteran. Not only that,
but the setting changes, the immediate goals change, et cetera. An
easy way to spot a bad “story,” (really more of a soapbox for the
author to try and cram their shitty useless feelings down your face)
is that NOTHING CHANGES. A character feels a certain way at the
beginning, and the text serves only to play out an illustration of
those feelings. Or, one thing happens, and then another thing
happens, and then another thing happens, with no coherency or overall
arc. <I>O</I>r, something is going to happen, we know it is going to
happen, and then it happens, with no deviation from what we know and
expect from word one. Another useful distinction, on that subject, is
that in a non-story, for the most part, things HAPPEN to people. In a
story, people DO things. 
</P>
<P>But this is too
abstract to help you write a story. Hopefully it WILL help you to
identify shitty ideas when you see them or (more importantly) when
you come up with them. To help you on a more immediate level, let’s
try an example. Why the hell not. We’ll see how this works.</P>
<h2>Making it a Story</h2>
<P>Okay so first you
need an idea, obviously. This is not hard. Everybody has ideas, all
the time. They are a product of our restless brains that do not turn
off. Let’s take a stupid idea I had last week and use that.</P>
<blockquote>
<P><I>Robots are
stealing and smuggling diamonds in order to manufacture high-quality
machine parts. </I>
</P></blockquote>
<P>Okay. This is a
good place to start. Already, we can start asking ourselves
questions: Who, if anyone, is controlling the robots? Who made them?
What do they want? But notice that my idea here, while interesting,
is not particularly intriguing. Or more accurately, there’s nowhere
for it to go. Robots are stealing diamonds. That is what is
happening, and you have no reason to believe that that will stop
happening or lead to anything else in the near future. In fact, there
is no future, explicit or implied, and so there is no story. Okay. So
how do we make it a story? It needs something to change over the
course of it, or at least present the threat of change. Try:</P>
<blockquote>

<P><I>Robots are
stealing and smuggling diamonds to manufacture high quality machine
parts. They are building a giant robot to take all the gold in Fort
Knox, and thus seize political power for themselves.</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P>Awesome. Better,
right? Now we’ve got something to look forward to: Will the robots
be successful? Also, notice that the complication of the premise here
comes as a direct result of answering one of the questions I asked in
the last paragraph: What do the robots want. This is probably the
most important question you can ask about any of your characters in
any of your stories. Figure out what your characters want, and you
can more efficiently and effectively keep them from getting it.
Keeping characters from getting things they want is one of the main
things that makes stories awesome. The best storytellers are adept at
letting their characters get within inches of their goals and then
swatting them deftly away.</P>
<P>So back to my robot
shenanigans. What I’ve got here is still basically just a premise,
mainly because of the lack of any obstacles. I need to add some other
forces to oppose the robots in order to generate tension, and
facilitate a satisfying conclusion.</P>
<P>I don’t
necessarily believe in knowing how a story will end when you start
writing it, but what you DO need is to provide at least two competing
forces from the getgo. While gold-stealing robots are pretty cool,
this story won’t be much fun if the robots pull off their heist
without a hitch. So let’s add an obstacle.</P>
<blockquote>
<P><I>ForeverCo, the
world’s largest diamond importer, notices a string of mysterious
heists and hires private detective Bod Nevada to look into the case.
What Bod discovers will fling him into a world of machines and
megalomaniacal schemes, ultimately implicating an army of robots …
and ForeverCo itself.</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P>Guys, do you want
to read this story? Of course you want to read this story. It is
awesome. It has gold, robots, private detectives and evil
corporations. Not only that, but all of these things are in more or
less direct opposition with each other. 
</P>
<P>Notice, I still
don’t have an ending, but I have a general idea where it will go.
It will have something to do with ForeverCo being responsible for the
existence of the evil robot army; after all, if the robots needed
diamonds to make their parts to begin with, who supplied the
diamonds? But we’re getting off topic. Basically what I did here is
I took a silly idea about robots, I made it a threat by giving it a
goal, and then I created an opposing force (actually two: ForeverCo
and Bod Nevada) to oppose the threat. How did I do it?</P>

<P>I hinted at this
before, but basically my whole story-forming process amounts to
asking myself questions and then answering them. Who made the robots?
Foreverco. What do they want? Autonomy. Who is controlling them? No
one. They are totally out of control. Will they succeed? I don’t
know yet. That’s why I’m writing the story. 
</P>
<P>A good story is
(usually if not always) internally consistent. The way you get an
internally consistent story is by asking yourself these kinds of
questions and making decisions, allowing your story to develop
organically. You’ll find that it’s usually impossible to answer
every single question before you start writing, that you have to
“unlock” certain answers by putting words on the page. 
</P>
<P>Now let’s be
clear. I don’t advocate any kind of formula for coming up with
stories. This is not a story template or a creativity machine. Hell,
you might try to write a prose story adhering to the keyword format
of a sestina, or because you came up with a character name you really
really like. What I’m giving you here is basically just the
collection of processes I use to generate a traditional story, or to
tell if what I’m writing is actually a story or just a mushy bag of
words. 
</P>
<P>You may groan at
the word “traditional” but this stuff is traditional for a
reason. It works. It entertains people and they like it. If you want
to get all avant-gardey on me, you go right ahead. But remember (to
use a trite example) Picasso was a goddamn realist before he started
putting people’s noses on the sides of their heads. The surrealists
render all their melty clocks and disembodied boobs with photographic
accuracy. And those guys who take canvasses and paint them orange and
sell them for thousands of dollars? Fuck those guys. They are
useless. If you’re going to try something new, make damn sure you
can already do something old. And well.</P>
<h2>Okay Time to Actually Start a Story</h2>
<P>With that rant out
of the way, we can move into the writing of the story itself. Logic
would dictate that we start at the beginning with the first sentence.
But the first sentence is hard, and sometimes you won’t know what
it ought to be (or what the title should be, either) until you’ve
written at least a few paragraphs. You might even need to get through
the whole story before you know how to start it. The first line is
also the hardest because each word you put on the page is a limiting
factor on the words you can follow it with. Without any words on the
page, you’ve got nothing but possibilities, and possibilities are
scary. So I’m going to do you a favor. I will write the first
sentence of your story for you.</P>
<P>If you are stuck,
copy this sentence into your empty document:</P>
<blockquote>
<P><I>Asdlkajsdakjhfzxkbcksjadlksjdh.</I></P>

</blockquote>
<P>Fuck the sanctity
of the first sentence. The important thing is that you start moving
your fingers on the keyboard, and putting some black things on your
white page. Then go ahead and write the second sentence of the story.
Without the pressure of capturing the reader’s attention with a
well-crafted opening, feel free to launch directly into a description
of what is going on as your story begins. This sentence can be as
boring and straightforward as you want. No pressure. You may find
that your second sentence is really destined to be your first
sentence after all!</P>
<P>Speaking of which,
I suppose a word is in order on when to begin your story, in terms of
the overarching narrative. Some famous writer guy once said: Your
story should start just after it begins and end right before the end.
People are smart. At least, you want to believe the people reading
your stories are smart. They can stand being thrown into the middle
of shit. If you find yourself dutifully plodding along, doing all
kinds of boring work to get your characters to the place where the
first “interesting” thing happens, you have started your story
too early. Good place to start your story: 
</P>
<blockquote>
<P><I>Two ForeverCo
employees kicked down my door right as I was choking down my stale
coffee. “We’ve got a job for you,” said the fat one.</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P>Totally lame place
to start a story:</P>
<blockquote>
<P><I>	I woke up too early, left my
apartment without shaving or brushing my teeth, got some shitty
coffee from a street stand, unlocked the door of my decrepit
apartment building, climbed the six flights to my office, and sat
down to collect my thoughts. Without warning, two ForeverCo employees
kicked down my door …</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P>	It won’t always be that obvious.
You’ll often need someone else to tell you you’ve started your
story too late. But stay aware of that kind of thing. Try to start
the action at the last possible second. And err on the side of too
late, rather than too early. A lot of good  sci-fi, for example,
hurls us into the middle of a storm of jargon and unfamiliar tech,
and expects us to catch up. Imagine having to read the origin of
every bionic arm and superdrug before we even got to the plot!</P>

<h2>Tools of the trade?</h2>
<P>	Okay, so we’ve started the story. We
should be going along at a pretty good clip now. Obviously, I can’t
write your story for you, so the actual writey parts of it are up to
you. Honestly the best way to get better at writing is to read the
authors you like, and figure out why you like them, and then do those
things. I can, however, give you some tools and point out some things
you might not have considered.</P>
<blockquote>
<P>	<B>Characters:</B> People will decide
how good of a writer you are based largely on your characters. As
mentioned before, you want to make sure your characters mainly DO
things, as opposed to having things happen to them. However, don’t
make your characters remote-control dolls whose sole purpose is to do
things you have decided they should do. Ideally, your story will
actually be driven by your characters, and you may find yourself in a
situation where your tale must diverge from your plans because your
character simply refuses to do the thing you want him to. The trick
is creating living characters and dropping them into the world of
your story. Easier said than done? No. Very easy to do.</P>
<P>	Here’s what you do: give your
character an eyepatch. Or a pegleg. Or even something less piratey
like a Mohawk or acrylic nails. Now, some say that this is a silly
and shallow way to identify a character, but I’m not saying that
your character should begin and end at the parrot on his shoulder.
No, no. Picking some colorful detail, however, will give you a
starting point for coming up with meatier aspects of the character’s
personality. Instead of saying “oh, he’s got huge ears” and
leaving it at that, try and imagine the kind of personality produced
by years of ear-mocking. Just like with plot, these tiny decisions
about appearance  yield a wealth of questions, and answering them is
what produces depth in your story. Lemme show you how this works:</P>
<blockquote>
<P>	<I>A man walked into my office. “What
do you want?” I said.</I></P>

<P><I>	“I don’t want, I need” said
the man. “I need you to solve a case for me.”</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P>Boring. He has big ears now:</P>
<blockquote>
<P>	<I>Into my office came a guy with ears
so big I thought he was gonna have to turn sideways to get through
the door. “What can I do for you, Dumbo?” I said.</I></P>
<P><I>	“You can find some manners, first
of all.” He scowled, finger-combing his hair down over his ears,
“And then I need you to solve a case for me.”</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P>I’m not even going to ask which was
more fun to read. All the slight differences in the second version
followed from my decision to give this unnamed man a pair of massive
ears. In real life, people are responding to what they see, hear,
feel and smell all the time. If you don’t give your characters
stuff to look at and play with in your story, their dialogue is
naturally going to end up boring.  Put a pack of cigarettes on the
table, have the smell of bacon waft in through the window.
Distractions, nonsequiturs, jokes and tangents are what make
conversations sound realistic. 
</P>
<P>What’s more,
distinguishing traits give your readers an anchor point in their
mind, from which to start constructing their own picture. If I say,
“A man walked into my office,” I’ve got no idea what kind of an
image you’re constructing in your head, if any. But if I say “A
man with massive ears walked into my office,” I’ve got a ballpark
idea of what you’re imagining. 

</P>
<P>	As a general rule, the better picture
I’ve got of a character in my head, the easier it is for me to
write dialogue for him or her. When I’m writing dialogue, I’m
trying to listen in to what the character would realistically say
next, given who they are and what they want. Also, the more dialogue
I write – obviously – the easier it gets. Other things you can do
to make your characters distinctive: Pick an animal they are similar
to, give them a slang, a nickname or a strong smell (smell is the
strongest sense associated memory. Use that to your advantage.)</P>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<P>	<B>The inciting incident/disorganizing
event:</B> This is a term for some crucial event that happened a long
time before the part of the story you’re writing about. Every good
story has one, pretty much. In our robot story, the inciting incident
might be an AI experiment by ForeverCo which produced
self-replicating machines with diamond parts just before the funding
was cut. In Superman, the inciting incident is the destruction of
krypton. We may hear about the inciting incident during the course of
the story, or it may be something that all of the characters simply
know about and never mention. Think of it as extremely concentrated
backstory. An inciting incident is important because it means that
stuff is already happening by the time we start reading. The plot is
in motion. It also gives the impression of a larger world outside of
your story. If I write a story called “I woke up this morning and
now there are dragons,” people are going to wonder where the
dragons came from. Whether or not I explicity mention it in my story,
knowing that the dragons were cloned by a mad scientist in a volcano
thirty years ago will add depth to my (unbelievably shitty) premise.</P>
<P>If you think about
your story, you may find that you already have an inciting incident.
If you don’t, then you should come up with one or start your story
later.</P>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<P>	<B>Information management:</B> As the
author, you are in possession of 100% of the facts of your story
basically at all times. Except in certain special cases, your
audience does not want this. If they already knew all the facts like
you do, they wouldn’t be reading the story, would they? Part of the
fun is discovering things as you go along. Uncertainty and
anticipation is what makes readers jump the gap between chapter 1 and
2. And 3 and 4. Et cetera.</P>

<P>	But it’s not enough to just keep
random things secret. Your reader has to want to know the thing
you’re hiding. And the best way to make your reader care about your
cool secrets is to tell them other cool secrets. The technical term
for this is dramatic irony.</P>
<P>	Dramatic irony is basically just when
the reader knows something that the characters in the story don’t.
In Oedipus Rex, Oedipus swears to find his father’s killer, when
any contemporary audience would have known it was Oedipus who killed
his father. Dramatic irony is the impulse that makes people shout
“Don’t go in there!” at horror movie heroines. There is no
better way to get your readers involved in the story.</P>
<P>	Dramatic irony is a tough trick to
pull off. Like a lot of writing, you’ve really just got to get a
feel for it by experimenting and reading other writers’ work. Try
to become conscious of opportunities for dramatic irony in your
stories. Whenever you’re setting your character up for a surprise,
ask yourself whether your audience will be more effected by the shock
of the big reveal, or the unbearable anticipation of watching the
character stumble blindly along. 
</P>
<P>	Speaking of the big reveal, a sudden
shock is always more shocking if it isn’t quite so sudden. What I
mean is that to truly blow your audience’s minds, it’s a good
idea to plant clues to your plot twist throughout, so that your
reader can smack their head and go “DAMMIT! Why didn’t I see that
coming? It was right there!” A surprise without any foreshadowing
is bound to feel unearned.</P>
<P>	Other aspects of information
management include placing clues in mysteries and deliberately
withholding information to force people to fill in their own or to
strengthen a particular narrative voice, but frankly I’m no expert
on any of this and so I won’t make this longer than it has to be.
Once again, your best bet is to read with a critical eye, and watch
exactly when you’re being told things. Kurt Vonnegut is good for
this.</P>
</blockquote>
<h2>Things You Probably Shouldn’t Do</h2>

<P>	Okay so those were some things you
should try to do. Here are some things you shouldn’t do. Like I
said, since I can’t write your story for you, and I can’t comment
on your specific weaknesses without one of your stories in front of
me, I’m going to cover common mistakes and ways to resolve them,
mainly to do with language and description. Here goes.</P>
<blockquote>
<P>	<B>Laying it on too thick: </B>We know
you know adjectives. You do not need to prove it to us. There are
very few situations where you will need to use more than one
adjective to describe something. And whenever possible, don’t use
adjectives at all. Try and replace them with visceral images or clues
in the behavior or characters that communicate the same information.
Example:</P>
<blockquote>
<P>	<I>He smelled wretchedly horrible.</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P><I>	</I>Versus</P>
<blockquote>

<P>	<I>He leaned towards me, and I
wrinkled my nose. He smelled of cigarettes and Brussels sprouts.</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P>	All too often, writers use adjectives
and adverbs to tell the audience how they should feel. And yet they
often have the exact opposite effect. Compare:</P>
<blockquote>
<P><I>	He brutally stabbed the hooks
through her quivering flesh and suspended her painfully from the
ceiling.</I></P>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<P>	<I>He put hooks through her skin and
hung her from the ceiling.</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P><I>	</I>Allow your readers to see
what’s actually going on, and respond to it as they naturally
would. Don’t put a bunch of adjectives in the way. And adverbs just
suck. Before you use an adverb, make sure you couldn’t say what
you’re trying to say any other way.</P>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<P>	<B>Passive Voice: </B>Passive voice
refers to a sentence like this:</P>
<blockquote>
<P>		<I>The package was intercepted by the
FBI.</I></P>
</blockquote>
<P>	Passive voice separates the action
from the actor. We could rewrite that sentence as:</P>
<blockquote>
<P>	<I>	The FBI Intercepted the Package</I></P>

</blockquote>
<P>	Passive voice adds unnecessary words
and makes your sentences less snappy. Don’t do it if you can avoid
it.</P>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<P>	<B>Description:</B> I can’t give you
any advice on this. You’re better off imitating the writers you
like to read. I personally hate long descriptions, but some people
really get off on them. For me, anything that isn’t immediately
relevant to the story gets usually gets left out, although irrelevant
details can be useful for setting the tone. Actually, hold on,
there’s some advice I can give. Keep a tiny notebook with you and
try and write down cool similes whenever you come up with them. It’s
unwise to rely too heavily on simile, but if you come up with a
really tight way of conveying an image, you need to save that.</P>
</blockquote>
<P>	The rest is just style, something you
develop by reading things you like, and reading things you hate, and
writing just about anything. At least to start, you will probably
produce the best stories when you write how you talk, because you
will be most at ease and you will have the largest base of experience
to draw upon. As you become more comfortable you can base your
authorial voice on those of your idols, or attempt to create a whole
new voice from a collage of people you’ve met in your life. Word
choice, sentence construction, and all that crap is something best
left to an editor after the fact. I can’t give you a lot of hard
and fast rules to govern those things a hundred percent of the time.
The best advice I can pass along in that area is what Mark Twain said
on the subject: “The difference between the almost right word and
the right word is the difference between the lightning bug and the
lightning.”</P>
<h2>You Wrote It. Now Write It Again.</h2>

<P>	And finally I guess I owe you a word
or two about revision? So here they are: If you’re writing a story
and you’re not having fun, stop. If you’re rewriting a story and
you’re not having fun, take a break, but keep in mind that that
probably means you’re doing it right. I’d advise letting a story
sit untouched for at least a couple of weeks after you write the
first draft. Let the words become alien to you so you’re less
precious about tearing them apart. Send your story to as many other
people as you can, but make sure you always have specific questions
for them. If you don’t, you’ll usually get comments like “I
liked it” or, “You sure had some characters.” And please,
please don’t ask people questions like “what did you think?” or
“what was your favorite line?” Those are questions geared towards
stroking your ego, not helping your writing. Also, and PLEASE
remember this, if you are in a writing workshop, and people are
criticizing your story, KEEP YOUR GODDAMN MOUTH SHUT. If your readers
didn’t understand that the main character was a psychic werewolf
the entire time, it is your fault that they did not understand that,
and interrupting to explain it now is not going to help anyone. Just
smile, take notes, and maybe make violent doodles in the margins.</P>
<P>There are some
people for whom rewriting is their favorite part of the process. I am
not one of those people and if you are you are super lucky and I envy
you a little. 
</P>
<h2>Okay I’m Done.</h2>
<P>	Everything I’m telling you pretty
much boils down to one thing: You want to put some effort into
setting up your world, picturing your character, answering your own
questions about your story. For me, story writing is an extended
interview with myself, in which I gradually uncover what turn out to
be the only possible solutions to the dilemma of the tale I’m
telling. That’s how you get believability, by building the story
upon itself. There are lots of dos and don’ts for writing, and a
lot of them are directly contradictory. Ultimately, if you’ve put
in the time developing your story and characters, creating real
people in a real scenario (note: do not confuse “real” with
“realistic”) you will naturally avoid a lot of the plot problems
that come up in amateurish writing. Good writing is like grass,
growing from the soil up. Bad writing is like Astroturf.</P>
<P>	I’d love to get all practical here
and walk you through how I write a story step by step, but that would
require an article longer than the story itself, and frankly I don’t
think it would be particularly helpful. If you choose to seriously
pursue writing, you’re going to end up doing bad imitations of a
lot of people before you find a style you’re comfortable with.
You’re going to read a lot of writers writing about writing, and
you’re going to hear more or less the same thing from all of them:
You need to write. You need to write a lot. And you need to read. So
go do that.</P>
