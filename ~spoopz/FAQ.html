Question 1: How did you get into web development?
<br>
I wanted to add a funky image to my tumblr blog and it involved diving into the theme code manually putting the image in (some themes let you do this in options but the theme i had at the time didn't)
<br>
I was like "hmmmm, this is actually pretty fun"
<br>
Next thing I knew i made an account on neocities
<br>
