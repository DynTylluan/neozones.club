Ricky the raccoon is the mascot of NeoZones. He is diagnosed with rabies and terminal baby disease. Before his job at NeoZones, Ricky was often found at a dumpster behind a local WalMart suffering from a cocaine addiction. He may look like a cute baby raccoon, but Ricky has a criminal record to his name including charges of vandalism, arson, and drug possession. However, he has claimed to be sober since then.</p></article><br>

<h2><a href="/~bytemoth/">Bytemoth</a></h2>
<p><img width=252 height=252 src="bytemoth.png" class=fl alt="" title="LIKE A BOSS">
Bytemoth is said to have emerged, fully formed, from the same puff of logic that obliterated Yahweh in 2012. He claims to be a digital warlock with dominion over many strange magickal realms, including a text-based forest, a cosmic dungeon with 5000 levels, and an <a href="//bytemoth.neocities.org/">'electric brook'</a>.</p>
<p>
He was last seen attempting to use forbidden technomancy powers to revive the year 2009. As of the time of writing, he appears to be trapped within a temporal dilation vortex, resulting in the current glacial pace of updates to his websites and blogs.</p>

 this to say:</p>
 <p>
"Now listen to me young man, I am talking directly into your ear now. I need you to dome a favor. You will do this for me. I need you to go to Hollywood Video, and I need you to ask the bastard working the counter if they have <i>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</i> on VHS. If you come back empty handed you will be in big trouble mister. You will never see the light of day."</p>

Randy Asui, also known as <a href="//tehleroy.neocities.org/">TEH LEROY</a>, was a graphic artist and systems engineering student, born 20 years ago in Fuckville, Vuvuzela.</p>
<p>
On March 12, 2019, mysteriously disappeared without a trace, after a blackout that affected his country for several days and to date his whereabouts is unknown. People close to him, claim to have seen him being dragged into a black hole and probably killing him immediately or being teleported to another dimension.</p>
<p>
Some theorists and scientists claim that the lack of electricity and the accumulation of stress energy will have "teleported" him to the stone age. as well as several current evidences indicate that it is possible that he invented Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.</p>
<p>
Recently, in a cave in Tiaxcala, Mexico, several writings carved in limestone were found with messages that he probably marked with sticks. One of the messages says <i>"I'm gonna write the N-word!!"</i>, followed by another that for several reasons will not be mentioned.</p>
