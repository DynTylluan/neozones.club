Postcards from Ladybird: 100 Classic Ladybird Covers in One</p>
<p>
For those not from the UK, Ladybird Books are known for making fun children books, that have just lovely looking drawings inside of them. This is <em>not</em> a book, but more of a box of sorts that hold 100 postcards. The postcards can hold a lot of memory surrounding the original book, so sending th epostcards to people, and risking them getting harmed might not be the best idea.
