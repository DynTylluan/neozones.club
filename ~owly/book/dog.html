My dog, Rue, who is a female sighthound and definitely a mix of other things.
<p>
She is probably around 8 or 9 years as of when this photo was taken, but her age is a bit of a mystery, and she may be older, or hell, even younger. Much like other sighthounds, she is happy to run around on a field for an hour or so, then spend the rest of the day lazing around the house - what a hard life it is for a dog. We also have second dog called Albert, who is probably 4, although there aren't any recent photos of him posted on the Web.
