	It's either real or it's a dream, there's nothing that is in between. Welcome to <a href="/~owly/0/">After Dark</a>, kind of like a blog, but full of offhand, weird, worrying, and obnoxious things that I publish, along with it being the home of some edgy shit. Everyone will soon know the truth, did I just write that?
	<p></p>
	The point of After Dark is to be a more sudden version of the articles that I publish in <a href="https://neozones.club/acidjaw/">AcidJaw</a> witht he aim of this blog-type-thing being more about me rather than a subject.
	<p></p>
	Please note that posts pre-dating <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/midnight/58.html">2019-12-25</a> might have outdated information, remarks, or even broken links in them, so be aware, also know that once-in-a blue moon, there can be NSFW content in the posts.
