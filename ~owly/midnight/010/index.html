	<h1>US-UK Metal</h1>
Hello, my name is Clive and I run this site.
<P>
This is sort of a late night blog update - I don't really like using the word "blog" but hey, whatever.
<P>
Anyway, right now it's 25/04/2017 @ 00:49 and in about 
7 hours I need to be up to meet one of my wanker mates.
<P>
I'm playing "Stained Class" by Judas Priest - you know, 
I quite like the whole album, it was the first Priest 
album that I played and that was simply because of 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/jpfcs.html">Belknap and Vance</a> - it's weird that a double suicide 
in the 80's would cause me to become a heavy metal fan. 
Before all I would play was "The Beatles", "David Bowie" 
and "ABBA" - not that any of the bands/singers are bad - 
but it's quite different from playing say "Metallica", 
"Pantera", "Black Sabbath" etc.
<P>
Thinking about it, it was my destiny in a weird way - 
an example of this would be that my Dad has always been 
a fan of AC/DC and the like. Or at least in my eyes.
<P>
Metal is a weird type of music; it has been the blame 
of the God Squad a lot; being the blame of Satanic 
rituals and other bull shit.
<P>
I know (or at least I think from what I see) in North 
America people are much more religious than in the UK 
and because of that, metal gets the shit end of the stick. 
People go "don't play that! It's Evil music! Read the 
Bible!" - if anyone told me that, I'd tell then to fuck off.
<P>
Nothing is wrong with music.
<P>
From what I can tell, the US o A is really Christian 
and proud to be American. Yeah, I believed in God and 
the like when I was about 8 or so, then I just stopped 
believing in it all. In the UK we're more... <i>reserved</i>... 
about our history and the only people why are proud to 
be British are crazy people. I saw a post on Reddit 
once that I think sums it all up, "<a href="https://reddit.com/r/BritishSuccess/comments/5p55d5/im_not_proud_to_be_british_but_im_bloody_grateful/">I'm not proud to 
be British, but I'm bloody grateful</a>".
<P>
It's weird that I've lived my whole life on a tiny 
island really.
<P>
Visit us one day won't you? The UK is full of great 
places. Also, watch our TV, we have so great shows. 
I don't mean ones you know about like The Office and 
Monty Python, I mean ones that you may not know about; 
The Young Ones, Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe, QI, News 
of The World, Have I Got News For You and fuck anything 
on BBC 4.
<P>
I love you all, my web surfers.
<P>
The time is now 01:27
